Below are separate Mermaid.js code blocks, each representing a distinct subgraph based on the provided content about Claude's concepts and relationships. Each block is designed to be rendered as an individual image in a Mermaid-compatible editor (e.g., Mermaid Live Editor).

### 1. Extended Thinking Mode & Thinking Budget
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Extended Thinking Mode] -->|Controlled by| B(Thinking Budget)
    B -->|Determines| C(Time and Effort Spent)
    C -->|In| A
```

### 2. Visible Thought Process & Faithfulness
```mermaid
graph TD
    D[Visible Thought Process] -->|External Display| E(Claude's Internal Reasoning)
    F[Faithfulness] -->|Assesses| G(Accuracy of Representation)
    G -->|Of| D
    F -->|Measures| H(Truthfulness in Decision-Making)
```

    I -->|Improves| K(Effective Environment Interaction)
    K -->|Of| J
```

### 5. Serial Test-Time Compute & Parallel Test-Time Compute
```mermaid
graph TD
    N[Serial Test-Time Compute] -->|Method| O(Sequential Reasoning Steps)
    P[Parallel Test-Time Compute] -->|Method| Q(Sampling Multiple Thought Processes)
    N -->|Improves| R(Claude's Performance)
    P -->|Improves| R
```

### 7. AI Safety Level (ASL) & Constitutional Classifiers
```mermaid
graph TD
    U[AI Safety Level - ASL] -->|Requires| V[Safety Measures]
    W[Constitutional Classifiers] -->|Helps Meet| V
    W -->|Supports| U
```

### 8. Visible Thought Process & AI Safety Level (ASL)
```mermaid
graph TD
    D[Visible Thought Process] -->|Requires| X(Safeguards)
    X -->|At| U[AI Safety Level - ASL]
    X -->|Prevents| Y(Harmful Content Display)
```

### 9. Prompt Injection Attacks & Computer Use
```mermaid
graph TD
    Z[Prompt Injection Attacks] -->|Target| AA(Computer Use)
    AB[Safety Measures] -->|Defend Against| Z
    AB -->|Protect| AA
    AA -->|By| AC(Claude)
```

### Instructions:
- **Rendering**: Copy each code block into a Mermaid-compatible tool (e.g., `mermaid.live`) to generate a separate image for each subgraph.
- **Node Labels**: I’ve reused node labels where appropriate (e.g., "D" for "Visible Thought Process" in Subgraphs 2 and 8), as each block is independent and won’t conflict when rendered separately.
- **Purpose**: Each subgraph isolates a specific relationship between concepts, providing a clear visual representation of their logical connections.

Let me know if you’d like any subgraphs adjusted, combined, or further detailed!
