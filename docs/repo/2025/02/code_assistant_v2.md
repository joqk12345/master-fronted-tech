Below are separate Mermaid.js code blocks, each representing a distinct subgraph based on the provided content about **Syntax Parsing**, **Codeium-Parse**, and related concepts. Each block is designed to be rendered as an individual image in a Mermaid-compatible editor (e.g., Mermaid Live Editor).

### 1. Syntax Parsing Enables Features
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Syntax Parsing] -->|Enables| B(AI-Powered Code Autocomplete)
    A -->|Enables| C(Repo-Wide Semantic Search)
```

---

### 2. Codeium-Parse as a Tool
```mermaid
graph TD
    D[Codeium-Parse] -->|Designed to Perform| A[Syntax Parsing]
    D -->|Across| E(Multiple Languages)
    D -->|Type| F(Open-Source Tool)
```

---

### 3. Repo-Wide Semantic Search and Embeddings
```mermaid
graph TD
    C[Repo-Wide Semantic Search] -->|Uses| G(Embeddings)
    G -->|Of| H(Code Snippets)
    G -->|For| I(Find Relevant Code)
    I -->|Based on| J(Natural Language Queries)
```

---

### 4. Syntax Parsing and CST
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Syntax Parsing] -->|Involves Computing| K(Concrete Syntax Tree - CST)
```

---

### 5. Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) Purpose
```mermaid
graph TD
    K[Concrete Syntax Tree - CST] -->|Structured Representation| L(Code)
    K -->|Facilitates| M(Querying Specific Patterns)
```

---

### 6. Tree-Sitter and CST Production
```mermaid
graph TD
    N[Tree-Sitter] -->|Produces| K[Concrete Syntax Tree - CST]
    N -->|Uses| O(Grammars)
    N -->|Uses| P(Predicates)
    O -->|Language-Specific| N
```

---

### 7. Tree-Sitter Query Language
```mermaid
graph TD
    N[Tree-Sitter] -->|Has Built-In| Q(Query Language)
    Q -->|Captures| R(Subtrees within CST)
```

---

### 8. Query Language Application
```mermaid
graph TD
    Q[Query Language] -->|Identifies| S(Function Docstring)
    S -->|Within| K[Concrete Syntax Tree - CST]
```

---

### 9. Codeium-Parse Outputs
```mermaid
graph TD
    D[Codeium-Parse] -->|Produces| T(JSON Outputs)
    T -->|Ensures| U(Compatibility with Other Tools)
```

---

### 10. Overall Process
```mermaid
graph TD
    D[Codeium-Parse] -->|Uses| N[Tree-Sitter]
    N -->|Creates| K[Concrete Syntax Tree - CST]
    K -->|Allows| Q[Query Language]
    Q -->|Extracts| S(Function Docstring)
    K -->|Enables| B(AI-Powered Code Autocomplete)
    K -->|Enables| C[Repo-Wide Semantic Search]
    C -->|Uses| G(Embeddings)
    D -->|Outputs| T(JSON Outputs)
```

### Instructions:
- **Rendering**: Copy each code block into a Mermaid-compatible tool (e.g., `mermaid.live`) to generate a separate image for each subgraph.
- **Node Labels**: I’ve reused node labels (e.g., "A" for "Syntax Parsing") where appropriate, as each block is independent and won’t conflict when rendered separately.
- **Purpose**: Each subgraph isolates a specific logical connection or concept, with the final one summarizing the overall process.

Let me know if you’d like any subgraphs adjusted, combined, or further detailed!
