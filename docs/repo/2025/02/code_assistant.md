Below are separate Mermaid.js code blocks, each representing a distinct subgraph based on the provided breakdown of concepts related to **Syntax Parsing**, **Codeium-Parse**, and associated tools/processes. Each block is designed to be rendered as an individual image in a Mermaid-compatible editor (e.g., Mermaid Live Editor).

### 1. Definitions
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Syntax Parsing] -->|Definition| B(Analysis of Code Structure)
    B -->|Crucial for| C(High-Level Languages)
    B -->|Used in| D(Syntax Highlighting)
    E[Codeium-Parse] -->|Definition| F(Open-Source Tool for Consistent Parsing)
    G[Concrete Syntax Tree - CST] -->|Definition| H(Intermediate Code Representation)
    H -->|Facilitates| I(Pattern-Based Querying)
    J[Tree-Sitter] -->|Definition| K(Library for Producing CSTs)
    K -->|Known for| L(Incremental Parsing)
    K -->|Known for| M(Error Tolerance)

    O -->|Captures| P(CST Subtrees for Analysis)
```

### Instructions:
- **Rendering**: Copy each code block into a Mermaid-compatible tool (e.g., `mermaid.live`) to generate a separate image for each subgraph.
- **Node Labels**: I’ve reused node labels (e.g., "A" for "Syntax Parsing") where appropriate, as each block is independent and won’t conflict when rendered separately.
- **Purpose**: Each subgraph isolates a specific aspect (Definitions, Classification, etc.) of the breakdown, making it easy to visualize individual components.

Let me know if you’d like adjustments, such as combining subgraphs or refining specific relationships!
