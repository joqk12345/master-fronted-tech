Below is the content translated into **Mermaid** format, with each section represented as a separate Mermaid module (graph). I’ll use a combination of flowcharts (`graph TD`) to represent relationships and hierarchies clearly.

### 1. NSA's Core Goal
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[NSA's Core Goal] --> B(Enhance Long-Context Modeling)
    B --> C(Overcome Computational Bottlenecks)
    C --> D(Traditional Attention Mechanism)
    D --> E(Processing Extended Sequences)
```

---

### 2. Sparse Attention as a Solution
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Sparse Attention] --> B(Key Strategy)
    B --> C(Efficient Long-Context Modeling)
    C --> D(Selective Focus on Relevant Query-Key Pairs)
    A --> E(NSA: Example of Sparse Attention)

### 3. NSA's Hierarchical Approach

    B --> G(Sliding Window)
    G --> H(Captures Local Context with Fixed-Size Window)
    A --> I(Nt = )
    I --> J(Nt ≪ t: High Sparsity Ratio)

    E --> F(Optimized for Matrix Multiplication)
    E --> G(Blockwise Selection for Efficiency)
    A --> H(NSA Optimizations)
    H --> I(Balanced Arithmetic Intensity)
    H --> J(Tensor Core Utilization)
```

### 6. Efficient Architectures
```mermaid

    B --> C(Training and Prefilling)
    B --> D(Contiguous Memory Access)
    B --> E(Blockwise Computation)
    D --> F(High Throughput)
    E --> F
```

### 8. MoE (Mixture-of-Experts)
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[MoE: Mixture-of-Experts] --> B(Combines GQA and MoE)
    B --> C(27B Total Parameters)
    B --> D(3B Active Parameters)
    C --> E(Trade-off: Computation Cost vs. Performance)
    D --> E
```

### Combined Overview (Optional)
If you'd like a single diagram combining all sections, here’s a simplified version:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[NSA] --> B(Core Goal: Long-Context Modeling)
    A --> C(Sparse Attention)
    C --> D(Hierarchical Token Modeling)
    D --> E(Token Compression)
    D --> F(Token Selection)
    D --> G(Sliding Window)
    A --> H(Attention Mechanism)
    H --> I(Query)
    H --> J(Key)
    H --> K(Value)
    H --> L(KV-cache)
    A --> M(Hardware Considerations)
    M --> N(Arithmetic Intensity)
    M --> O(Tensor Cores)
    A --> P(Efficient Architectures: GQA, MQA)
    A --> Q(FlashAttention Speedup)
    A --> R(MoE: 27B Parameters, 3B Active)
```

Let me know if you want adjustments or further refinements! Each module is self-contained as requested, and I’ve kept the structure logical and hierarchical using Mermaid syntax.
