Below is a Mermaid.js representation of the content you provided earlier, where each section is split into a completely separate Mermaid diagram (unit). Each unit is independent, with its own `graph` definition, and reflects the hierarchical structure of the original content using `TD` (top-down) direction for clarity. These can be rendered individually or combined as needed.

### 1. Attention as Classification
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Attention as Classification] --> B[Viewed as a classification problem]
    B --> C[Attention Weight]
    C --> D[Derived from Q  and K  via linear operations]
    B --> E[Output of Attention]
    E --> F[Which rows of V  should be picked]
```

### 2. Multi-Head Attention Benefits
```mermaid
graph TD

    AB --> AF[Sizable register file on streaming multiprocessor]
    AF --> AG[Enables allocating many registers]
```

### 7. Stabilized Softmax
```mermaid
graph TD
    AH[Stabilized Softmax] --> AI[Necessary for numerical stability]
    AI --> AJ[Compute exponent of each component]
    AJ --> AK[Divide by sum of all components]

### 9. Flash Attention Limitations & Considerations
```mermaid
graph TD
    AR[Flash Attention Limitations & Considerations] --> AS[Masks lead to non-rectangular block layouts]
    AS --> AT[Requires clever block allocation]
    AR --> AU[Uses CUTLASS for Tensor Cores]
    AR --> AV[Tile sizes  impact performance]
    AR --> AW[Considerations]
    AW --> AX[Shared memory limitations]
    AW --> AY[Register spilling]
```

### 10. Kernel Fusion
```mermaid
graph TD
    AZ[Kernel Fusion] --> BA[Fuse multiple matrix multiplications]
    BA --> BB[e.g., Q, K, V projections]
    BA --> BC[Improves performance]
    BC --> BD[Has limits]
```

### Notes:
- **Independent Units**: Each section is a standalone `graph TD`, making it a distinct Mermaid unit that can be rendered separately.
- **Structure**: The hierarchy follows the bullet-point levels, with arrows (`-->`) connecting related concepts.
- **Rendering**: You can paste each block into a Mermaid-compatible tool (e.g., `mermaid.live`) to visualize them individually.

Let me know if youâ€™d like any modifications, such as changing the direction (e.g., `LR` for left-right) or adjusting the layout!
