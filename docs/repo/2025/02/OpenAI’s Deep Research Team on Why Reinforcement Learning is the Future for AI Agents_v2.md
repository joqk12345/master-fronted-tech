### Instructions:
- **Rendering**: Copy each code block into a Mermaid-compatible tool (e.g., `mermaid.live`) to generate a separate image for each subgraph.
- **Node Labels**: I’ve kept node labels consistent where applicable (e.g., "D" for "Deep Research"), as each block is independent and won’t conflict when rendered separately.
- **Purpose**: Each subgraph focuses on a specific aspect of Deep Research, making it easy to visualize individual components of the system.

Let me know if you’d like any subgraphs combined, expanded, or modified further!
