### **CTR & CR Uplift Explanation**

In e-commerce and digital advertising, **CTR uplift** and **CR uplift** are key performance indicators used to measure the improvement in click-through and conversion rates after an optimization or intervention. They help assess the effectiveness of changes in an ad campaign, product listing, or website experience.

## **1. CTR Uplift (Click-Through Rate Uplift)**

### **What is CTR?**

- **Definition**: Click-Through Rate (CTR) measures the percentage of users who **click on an ad** after seeing it.

- **Formula**: 
  $$
  CTR = \frac{\text{Total Clicks}}{\text{Total Impressions}} \times 100\%
  $$
  

- **Purpose**: CTR indicates how engaging or relevant an ad or listing is to users. A higher CTR suggests that more people find the ad compelling.

### **CTR Uplift Definition**

- **CTR uplift** measures the **percentage increase in CTR** after implementing an optimization.

- **Formula**: 
  $$
  CTR\ Uplift = \frac{\text{New CTR} - \text{Baseline CTR}}{\text{Baseline CTR}} \times 100\%
  $$
  

- Example Calculation

  :

  - **Baseline CTR** = 2%
  - **New CTR** = 3%
  - **CTR Uplift** = 3%−2%2%×100%=50%\frac{3\% - 2\%}{2\%} \times 100\% = 50\%
     This means the optimization improved the **click-through rate by 50%**.

## **2. CR Uplift (Conversion Rate Uplift)**

### **What is CR?**

- **Definition**: Conversion Rate (CR) measures the percentage of users who **complete a desired action** (e.g., making a purchase) after clicking on an ad or visiting a product page.

- **Formula**: 
  $$
  CR = \frac{\text{Total Conversions}}{\text{Total Clicks}} \times 100\%
  $$
  

- **Purpose**: CR evaluates how effective a landing page, ad, or website is at driving purchases or other key actions.

### **CR Uplift Definition**

- **CR uplift** measures the **percentage increase in conversion rate** after making an improvement.

- **Formula**: 
  $$
  CR\ Uplift = \frac{\text{New CR} - \text{Baseline CR}}{\text{Baseline CR}} \times 100\%
  $$
  

- Example Calculation

  :

  - **Baseline CR** = 4%
  - **New CR** = 5%
  - **CR Uplift** = 5%−4%4%×100%=25%\frac{5\% - 4\%}{4\%} \times 100\% = 25\%
     This means the optimization improved the **conversion rate by 25%**.

## **3. Why Are CTR & CR Uplift Important?**

- **CTR uplift** reflects improvements in user engagement and ad relevance.
- **CR uplift** measures how well clicks convert into actual purchases or other desired actions.
- Both metrics help **optimize ad spend** and **improve user experience**, leading to higher **return on investment (ROI)**.
