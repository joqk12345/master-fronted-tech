### 2. Comparisons
```mermaid
graph TD
    B[Deep Research] -->|Second Release| C(Operator)
    B -->|Uses Fine-Tuned| E(O3)
    F[Traditional Search Products] -->|Less Flexible| B
    E -->|Better for Coding| B
```

    D[Reinforcement Learning - RL] -->|Critical Component| A[AI Agents]
    G[High-Quality Data Sets] -->|Determines Success| B[Deep Research]
    H[Detailed Instruction Following] -->|Best Results| B
    I[Expanding Data Sources] -->|Improves| B
    I -->|Future| J(Private Data)
```

    K[Scientific Methodology] -->|Develops| B[Deep Research]
    K --> L(Train Models on Browsing Tasks)
    K --> M(Optimize with RL)
    K --> N(Collect High-Quality Data Sets)
    K --> O(Iterative Improvement)
```

### 5. Logical Relationships
```mermaid
graph TD
    P[Logical Relationships] --> Q(AI Agents = Reasoning + Interaction)
    P --> R(Deep Research = AI Agent + RL + Browsing + Reports)
    P --> S(Success ≈ Quality of Data Sets)
    P --> T(Personalized Education = AI System + Customization)
```
