Below is a Mermaid.js representation of the provided content, where each section is a separate, standalone Mermaid unit (graph). Each unit uses `graph TD` (top-down) to reflect the hierarchical structure of the information clearly. These can be rendered individually in a Mermaid-compatible tool like `mermaid.live`.

### Explanation:
- **Standalone Units**: Each section is a fully independent `graph TD`, ensuring it can be rendered as a separate Mermaid unit.
- **Hierarchy**: The structure preserves the bullet-point levels, with arrows (`-->`) connecting concepts logically.
- **Clarity**: Descriptive node labels in square brackets `[ ]` make the diagrams self-explanatory.
- **Rendering**: Paste each block into a Mermaid-compatible editor (e.g., `mermaid.live`) to visualize them individually.

Let me know if youâ€™d like adjustments, such as changing the direction to `LR` (left-right) or refining the layout further!
