## 方法论



## 价值观与方法论哪个更厉害

> 方法论可以跨越（翻越）价值观

方法论为什么能翻越价值观，因为方法论是偏技法层面，而价值观是划定区域。愿景是偏方向性的北极星。



## 方法论与价值观

The source highlights the idea that **methodology can be more important than values when it comes to achieving success in writing**, even when the values differ significantly.

- The author describes working with a friend named Xiao Meng, who was tasked with writing an article.  Xiao Meng’s personal values were quite different from the author's, yet by applying the writing methodologies the author shared, he was able to produce a widely successful article.  **This demonstrates that the effectiveness of the methods transcended the difference in values.**
- This example leads the author to conclude that certain writing methodologies are so powerful that they can **transcend personal values** and still lead to success.

**The source ultimately argues for the importance of finding effective methodologies and consistently applying them, regardless of personal values, to achieve success in any endeavor, including writing.**  This builds on the idea we have been discussing about identifying the “right things” to do.  The “right things” in this case are the effective writing methodologies that can lead to success.
