# elusive create genius 难以琢磨创造力



关于创造力和努力合一的想法，在近500年，自文艺复兴时期在出现，之前的人民不是这么想的，素材

* 古代希腊
  * People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons. The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity *“daemons.”* Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke [wisdom ](https://singjupost.com/dr-rick-rigsby-the-wisdom-of-a-third-grade-dropout-will-change-your-life-transcript/)to him from afar.

* 古代罗马
  * The Romans had the same idea, but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius. Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual. They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist’s studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work.

* So brilliant — there it is, right there, that distance that I’m talking about — that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work. And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right? So the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like, for example, too much [narcissism](https://singjupost.com/young-women-narcissism-and-the-selfie-phenomenon-mary-mcgill-transcript/), right? If your work was brilliant, you couldn’t take all the credit for it, everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you. If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know? Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.

## 文艺复兴之后人民的观点改变

* 不再是你有 天赋，而是你和天赋是一体的
* - **直译**：你开始听到人们把这个或那个艺术家称作是天才，而不是拥有天赋。
  - **意译**：你开始听到人们说这个或那个艺术家本身就是天才，而非仅仅具备天赋。 

And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time. And then the Renaissance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was, let’s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries, and there’s no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine. And it’s the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual. And for the first time in history, you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius, rather than having a genius.

* 我觉得，要是让某个人，就一个普通人，去相信自己仿佛是承载所有神圣、创造、未知与永恒奥秘的源泉，这对脆弱的人类心灵而言，责任实在是有点过重了。
* 在这种压力下在过去500年的时间里一直在谋杀艺术家。

因为就解释创作过程那极度令人抓狂的反复无常而言，这说法跟我以往听过的任何解释一样在理。

It just completely warps and distorts egos, and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance. And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.

有一个美国诗人（Ruth Stone）灵感来临的例子：

* I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone, who’s now in her 90s, but she’s been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia, she would be out working in the fields, and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape. And she said it was like a thunderous train of air. And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.

## 真正的创造过程

* 所以创新的过程其实这么一个过程，你和你的那个精灵一起协作的过程。你的责任是像头骡子，每天按时起床，挥汗劳作，艰难的应付工作。

* > It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration, kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite Tom.

  它可能是这种奇特、奇妙、怪异的合作，有点像是汤姆与那个有点不像汤姆的奇怪外部事物之间的交谈。

  这或许是一场奇特、奇妙又怪异的 “合作”，有点类似汤姆与某种奇特的外在之物之间的对话，而这个外在之物与汤姆又并非完全相同。

1. 我可不是流水线作业！我就像头骡子，每天都得按时起床，挥汗劳作，艰难地应付工作。可就算像我这么执拗的人，偶尔也会碰上那种事儿。你懂的，就连我也有过工作灵感或想法莫名冒出来，我都不知道从哪儿来的。
2.  I’m not the pipeline! I’m a mule, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly. But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times. And I would imagine that a lot of you have too. You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify. 
3. 我曾有一些成果或想法涌现，但我确实不知其源自何处。
