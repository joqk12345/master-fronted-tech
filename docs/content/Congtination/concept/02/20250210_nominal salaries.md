# nominal salaries



> 名义工资就像名义利率一样，名义工资就是一个市场价，大家对与工资的定义也会影响一个人的决策。但是学会了与人就打交道的能力就会在市场上更值钱，比如果一個人擁有技術知識，並且有能力表達想法、發揮領導作用、激發人們的熱情，那麼這個人就會獲得更高的收入。

They came to me because they had finally realized, after years of observation and experience, that the highest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently not those who know the most about engineering. One can for example, hire mere technical ability in engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at nominal salaries. 

> But the person who has technical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people-that person is headed for higher earning power.
