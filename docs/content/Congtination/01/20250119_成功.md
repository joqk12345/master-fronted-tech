# 成功

**success is not solely determined by hard work, but by making the right choices**. 

 **prioritizing thoughtful decision-making over blind effort.** 

**Effort is not a guarantee of success because while it is a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one.**  Effort alone does not guarantee that you are doing the right thing, which is the **true key to success**.

 **success comes from doing the right things in the right way**, not simply from working hard. He illustrates this point with several examples:

- He highlights how many people who bought stock in newly public companies, including companies like Baidu and Alibaba, sold their shares early because they saw the internal problems of the companies. They missed out on significant gains because they failed to recognize the company's successful choices despite internal issues.
- He uses the example of New Oriental, an education company he worked for, which successfully focused on overseas test preparation rather than the more difficult and competitive college entrance exam preparation market.  This strategic choice contributed significantly to the company's growth even though it wasn't widely recognized as a core competency.
- He compares this concept to writing, arguing that the key to success is consistent writing, not just effort or motivation.

**while effort is necessary, it is the act of identifying and executing the "right things" that ultimately determines success. **
