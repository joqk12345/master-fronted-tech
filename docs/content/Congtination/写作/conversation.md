# conversation（沟通之对话）

沟通的最大的心法是 *Be interested in other people*.



You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home. People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she’d say, *“Do you know who that was? She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize. He’s a Russian ballet dancer.”* And I kind of grew up assuming **everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them**. And honestly, I think it’s what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I’m always prepared to be amazed, and I’m never disappointed.

Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, *“Most of us don’t listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply.”*

## Conversation Skill

**1. Don’t Multitask:** To have a productive conversation, be fully present. Put away distractions like your smartphone and give your complete attention to the person you’re talking to.

**2. Don’t Pontificate:** Approach conversations with an open mind and the assumption that you have something to learn. Avoid turning discussions into one-sided monologues where your opinion dominates.

**3. Use Open-Ended Questions:** Encourage deeper and more interesting responses by starting your questions with who, what, when, where, why, or how. Avoid asking questions that can be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.”

**4. Go with the Flow:** Allow thoughts to come and go naturally. Avoid interrupting the speaker with your own thoughts or anecdotes. This keeps the conversation on track and respectful of the speaker’s perspective.

**5. If You Don’t Know, Say That You Don’t Know:** Be honest about your knowledge limitations. It’s better to admit when you lack information than to pretend you know something you don’t. This helps build trust in the conversation.

**6. Don’t Equate Your Experience with Theirs:** Avoid the urge to share your own similar experiences when someone is sharing theirs. Every individual’s experiences are unique, and the conversation should focus on their story, not yours.

**7. Try Not to Repeat Yourself:** Repetition can be condescending and boring. Avoid restating your points excessively during a conversation. Respect your listener’s intelligence.

**8. Stay Out of the Weeds:** Don’t get bogged down in unnecessary details, especially in casual conversations. Focus on the broader themes and emotions rather than specific dates, names, and statistics.

**9. Listen:** Listening is the most crucial aspect of a conversation. Be genuinely interested in what the other person is saying, and don’t just listen to respond. The speaker should feel heard and understood.

**10. Be Brief:** Keep your contributions concise and to the point. A good conversation is like a miniskirt, **“short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.”**
