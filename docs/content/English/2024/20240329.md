# title 超级专业

# chinese 

说服一个人或者很多人的时候，通常情况下，人们以为的两个工具彻底无效的，第一是逻辑，第二是权威。
说服这个东西靠权威靠逻辑是没有用的，要靠专业，首先你必须很专业，并且你得有办法让人觉得你很专业，认同你很专业的这个事实，人家才会竖起耳朵来听你的见解。 别说说服的本质了，哪里都一样，一切的卓越都来自于专业，甚至他们会互为因果，因为专业所以卓越，因为卓越，所以专业，那我们干脆用另外一个词吧，叫做超群，所谓的超群，很简单，就是超越绝大多数。男人要凶悍，女人要彪悍。做人就要做个猛人，你不猛你不是很猛，你怎么可能超群，你不超群，你泯人众人，你还想有不普通的生活，你这不是痴心妄想吗 ？做个猛人是超群的唯一出路。

In the game of persuasion, the tools folks often rely on, logic and authority, don't cut it. It's all about expertise. You've gotta be top-notch, and more importantly, make others see that in you. Only then will they sit up and listen.

Let's not even get started on the core of persuasion. Everywhere you turn, excellence sprouts from expertise. They're two peas in a pod: expertise breeds excellence, and vice versa. Let's coin a term for this: "standing out", or simply, outpacing the majority.

Men need to be tough, women, fierce. Living life means being a powerhouse. If you're not fierce, how can you stand out? If you don't, you're just another face in the crowd. Dreaming of an extraordinary life while being ordinary? That's pie in the sky. Being a powerhouse is the only ticket to standing out.
