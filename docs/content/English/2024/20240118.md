从“长期周期”来看，当前的市场正处于大放水的顶峰，因为战争和疫情导致的供给端通胀严重，我们即将进入上世纪八十年代初开始的“里根大循环”的末期（40 Years Leveraging），全球央行（中国除外）都会进入加息周期去杠杆化。与此同时，疫情推动的数字科技和过去三十年来互联网增长的积累，我们正好处于新一轮的科技爆发期，那么除了继续印钞让市场看起来繁荣之外，驾驭新兴的数字科技来创造新财富，应该是在去杠杆的周期里能能让我们顺利还本付息的可选方法之一。

"Looking at the 'long-term cycle,' we're currently at the peak of a massive money-printing phase due to supply-side inflation triggered by war and pandemics. We're nearing the end of the 'Reagan's big cycle' that started in the early 80s (40 Years Leveraging), and central banks worldwide (except China) are entering a phase of tightening monetary policy to deleverage. At the same time, the pandemic has accelerated digital technology, and we're at the cusp of a new tech explosion, thanks to the momentum built over the past three decades of internet growth. So, besides continuing to print money to keep the markets looking prosperous, harnessing emerging digital technology to create new wealth could be one of the viable ways to smoothly repay debts and interest during the deleveraging phase."
