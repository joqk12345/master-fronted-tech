# title 大脑的潜能与后天发展的重要性

# chinese 

这段内容通过一个比喻，将人脑比作计算机，探讨了人类大脑的潜能和后天发展的重要性。作者通过创作一幅名为“宇宙”的抽象画，来象征人类大脑皮层的复杂性和独特性。以下是对这段内容的总结提炼：

1. **抽象画的创作**：作者使用AI辅助工具创作了一幅名为“宇宙”的抽象画，尺寸为45厘米见方，灵感来源于人类大脑皮层的展开图。

2. **大脑皮层的比喻**：大脑皮层大约是45厘米见方，厚度在3至5毫米之间，体积不到1000立方厘米。这幅画象征着人脑的复杂性，提醒作者所有的经历、思考和行动都发生在大脑皮层上。

3. **大脑的普遍性**：没有科学证据表明人与人之间在出生时大脑皮层的结构和功能有明显差异，大家的起点大致相同。

4. **仿生学与计算机**：许多产品是仿生学制作的，而计算机是人类史上最精深、最成功的仿生产品，被称为“电子大脑”，模仿人脑设计。

5. **计算机的比喻**：计算机可以用来理解人脑，就像商场里买的同样价格、配置、性能的电脑，经过一段时间使用后，它们发挥的价值可能有天壤之别。

6. **后天发展的重要性**：人与人之间的差异主要来自于后天的发展，包括硬件的升级（如大脑的生理发展）和软件的升级（如知识的学习和技能的培养）。

7. **婴儿的起点**：婴儿出生时，大脑体积大约是400立方厘米，到满岁时会长到将近1000立方厘米，这表明大脑的发展是迅速且显著的。

8. **计算机与人脑的比较**：每个人出生时，就像一台拥有基本相同硬件配置的计算机，具有输入设备、输出设备和处理设备，但软件和硬件都是最初级的状态，待发展。

通过这个比喻，作者强调了后天努力在个人发展中的重要性，以及每个人大脑的潜能和可塑性。

The passage explores the potential and importance of postnatal development in the human brain through an analogy that compares the human brain to a computer. The author creates an abstract painting called "Universe" with the assistance of AI tools, symbolizing the complexity and uniqueness of the human cerebral cortex. Here is a summary of the key points:

Creation of the abstract painting: The author uses AI-assisted tools to create an abstract painting called "Universe," measuring 45 centimeters on each side, inspired by the unfolded map of the human cerebral cortex.

Analogy of the cerebral cortex: The cerebral cortex is approximately 45 centimeters square, with a thickness ranging from 3 to 5 millimeters and a volume of less than 1000 cubic centimeters. The painting symbolizes the complexity of the human brain, reminding the author that all experiences, thoughts, and actions occur within the cerebral cortex.

Universality of the brain: There is no scientific evidence suggesting significant differences in the structure and function of the cerebral cortex among individuals at birth, indicating a similar starting point for everyone.

Bionics and computers: Many products are created through bionics, and computers are the most sophisticated and successful bionic products in human history, often referred to as "electronic brains" designed to mimic the human brain.

Analogy of computers: Computers can be used to understand the human brain, similar to purchasing computers with the same price, specifications, and performance in a store. However, after a period of use, their value and capabilities may differ significantly.

Importance of postnatal development: Differences among individuals primarily arise from postnatal development, including hardware upgrades (such as physiological development of the brain) and software upgrades (such as learning knowledge and developing skills).

Starting point of infants: At birth, an infant's brain volume is approximately 400 cubic centimeters, which grows to nearly 1000 cubic centimeters by the age of one, indicating rapid and significant brain development.

Comparison of computers and the human brain: Each person is born like a computer with basic hardware configuration, including input devices, output devices, and processing devices. However, both the software and hardware are in their most primitive state and await development.

Through this analogy, the author emphasizes the importance of postnatal efforts in personal development and highlights the potential and plasticity of the human brain.
