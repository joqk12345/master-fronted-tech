# title 人类情感的复杂性

# chinese 

这段内容继续探讨了人类情感的复杂性，特别是开心和伤心的根源。作者指出，大多数冷血动物如蛇、蜥蜴和鳄鱼，并没有复杂的记忆能力，它们依靠有限的反应来处理生活，例如：吃、打、交配、逃跑和什么都不干。这些动物因为缺乏记忆，也就没有比较和情感的复杂性。

然而，哺乳动物，包括人类，情况则不同。哺乳动物拥有情感，能够体验开心和伤心。作者认为，哺乳动物的记忆中开始发达，使得它们能够将现在与过去进行比较，而这种比较是开心与否的关键。没有记忆，就没有比较，也就没有开心或伤心的情感差异。

作者进一步分析，理论上，如果现在与过去比较，有一半的概率是更好的，那么开心和伤心的概率应该是对半开。但实际上，人们往往发现自己更多地处于伤心的状态，因为生活的真相是困难重重，而且过去并不好。这种持续的比较和感受到的苦难，让人们自然地得出结论，认为这辈子都过不好，从而感到悲观。

此外，作者还提到，过去人类存在的数万年间，世界的变化极为缓慢，人们的生活质量改善有限，因此大多数人感到悲观。作者指出，世界各地的宗教本质上都是以悲观者为目标，首先抚慰受伤的心灵，然后引导他们跟随宗教的教义。

最后，作者提出了一个问题：现在和将来如何比较？这是一个难点，因为过去已经发生并被体验，但将来还未到来，无法直接比较。这表明，人类对未来的乐观或悲观态度，可能更多地基于对过去和现在经验的推断，而不是直接的比较。

总结来说，这段内容强调了记忆和比较在形成人类情感中的作用，以及悲观情绪在人类历史中的普遍性。同时，它也提出了对未来乐观或悲观态度形成的思考。

The text delves into the complexities of human emotions, especially the origins of joy and sorrow. The author notes that most cold-blooded animals, such as snakes, lizards, and crocodiles, don't have complex memory, living life through basic reactions like eating, fighting, mating, fleeing, or being inactive. Their lack of memory means they don't experience the complexity of emotions that come with comparison.

Mammals, including humans, are different. They have emotions and can feel both happiness and sadness. The author believes that it's the development of memory in mammals that allows them to compare the present with the past, which is crucial for feeling happy or sad. Without memory, there is no comparison, and thus no emotional variance.

The author goes on to analyze that theoretically, if the present is compared to the past, there should be a fifty-fifty chance of it being better, which should mean equal chances for happiness or sadness. But in practice, people often find themselves sadder because life is tough and the past wasn't always great. This constant comparison and perceived hardship lead to a natural conclusion that life is mostly bad, resulting in pessimism.

Moreover, the author mentions that for tens of thousands of years of human existence, the world changed very slowly, and improvements in the quality of life were minimal, leading most people to feel pessimistic. The author points out that religions worldwide essentially target pessimists, first offering comfort to the wounded spirit, then guiding them to follow religious teachings.

Lastly, the author poses a question: How do we compare the present to the future? This is difficult because the past has been experienced, but the future has not, making direct comparison impossible. This suggests that our optimistic or pessimistic attitudes toward the future are likely based more on inferences from past and present experiences than on direct comparison.

In summary, the content highlights the role of memory and comparison in shaping human emotions and the commonality of pessimism throughout human history. It also presents thoughts on how attitudes toward the future, optimistic or pessimistic, are formed.
