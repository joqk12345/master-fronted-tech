摘要。虽然人们普遍认为洞察力是人工智能的关键益处，但事实上，人工智能通过改善决策质量来创造价值。好消息是，在商业领域，它有无数的机会这样做。但是因为一个领域的决策通常会影响其他领域的决策，所以引入人工智能往往涉及到重新审视和重新设计整个决策系统。让我们从一个具体的例子开始，看看在这个案例中，人工智能如何彻底改变了相关系统创造价值的方式。

新西兰是如何赢得美洲杯的
造船者和航海者已经精进了他们的技艺长达五千年。即便商业航运不再依赖风力推进，帆船创新也从未停止。

帆船领域的最高奖项（也是国际体育界最古老的奖杯）就是美洲杯。如今，比赛不仅是关于船员的技术，也是关于技术。数百万美元投入到船只设计中。由于风、水和船只的物理学原理已经被充分理解，参赛队伍使用模拟器来识别最有效的设计方案，并在实际建造之前测试船只。拥有最佳模拟器的队伍会获得巨大的优势，如2017年赢得美洲杯的新西兰酋长队。

爱迪生开启电灯后二十年，只有3%的美国企业使用了电力。

在准备2021年的比赛时，团队想知道是否能加快设计流程。与全球咨询公司麦肯锡合作，他们确定了创新的主要瓶颈：人类船员。让人类船员在模拟器中驾驶船只需要时间；无法增加他们对条件做出反应和相应操纵船只的速度。船员们在人类的时间尺度上工作，而这并不足够快。

团队采用类似击败世界顶尖围棋选手的人工智能技术，教会了一个AI程序如何航行。该机器人不需要睡眠或进食，它可以在相同时间内运行数千次模拟，而人类船员只能完成几次。八周后，AI开始在模拟器中击败船员。

事情变得有趣起来。AI开始教人类船员新技巧。正如开发团队成员告诉《连线》杂志，“机器人实际上做了一些对船员来说看似反直觉的事情，但他们会在水上尝试这些技巧，结果竟然有效。”以前，船只设计师需要人类来测试任何创新。弄清楚如何最好地使用新设计的船只可能需要几周的时间。

相比之下，AI可以同时实验多个船只变体，每天24小时不停歇。它可以尝试不同的竞赛策略。它加速了设计迭代周期和新技巧的发展。一旦AI找到更优的解决方案，人类船员就可以复制它。正如一位团队成员所说，“加速学习过程极具价值，既可以让设计团队尽可能多地探索设计空间，也可以让船员最大限度地发挥给定设计的性能。”那一年，新西兰酋长队赢得了奖杯，七胜三负。

为什么这种AI的应用如此新颖？除了令人印象深刻的复杂环境下的模拟技术之外，关键影响在于系统层面。AI并没有向新西兰酋长队提供一些洞察力，而是被构建进决策系统之中。

受到他在光学建模软件及光学畸变研究方面专业工作的启发，拉尔夫·雅各布斯在其艺术作品中结合了19世纪的青版印相术、数字谐波图以及由软件引导的激光投影，创造出无穷无尽的复杂椭圆线画。

赛前准备涉及两种类型的决策：关于船只设计的决策和关于航行技巧的决策。虽然模拟器长期以来一直用于船只设计，但航行技巧一直是由人类制定的。AI实际上并没有在比赛中驾驶船只——规则仍然要求真实的船只必须由真实的人驾驶——但它加速了创新过程，并使船只设计和航行技巧之间有更好的协调。模拟船只和AI船员组成的完整系统使这两种类型的决策都得到了改进。

为什么系统变革需要时间
新技术的系统性影响显现需要一段时间。当一项技术出现时，人们最初会狭隘地应用它。例如，当电力作为一种蒸汽动力的替代品发明出来时，企业只在难以获取蒸汽所需水源的地方使用它。爱迪生点亮电灯后的二十年里，只有3%的美国企业使用了电力。同样，在1987年，也就是计算机进入企业几十年后，经济学家罗伯特·索洛指出：“你可以在所有地方看到计算机时代，唯独在生产率统计中看不到。”计算技术的潜力显而易见，但其影响仍然微弱。

人工智能也是如此。尽管有些不同的品牌包装，新的AI技术基本上是统计学的进步。它们使得预测更加多维，并且能够利用原本未被利用的数据。它们的初期应用集中在它们能够立即提供的方面：比人类更准确、更便宜的预测。

翻译软件是AI的一个早期应用，它基于人类如何翻译先前文本的方式来预测如何将给定文本从一种语言翻译成另一种语言。另一个早期应用是AI对医疗影像的分类，它预测专家放射科医师会说扫描显示什么。这两个应用都利用了群体智慧，这通常比单个人做出的预测更为准确。像这样的应用可以具有巨大的商业价值。比如加拿大公司Verafin就被纳斯达克以27.5亿美元收购，原因就是它的AI驱动技术用于识别金融欺诈，被数百家金融机构作为安全团队功能的替代品。

这些新应用可能会推动一些重要的进展，但它们远非变革性的。它们融入现有企业而不引起太多麻烦，精确地取代了传统上进行预测的人类。除此之外，企业保持不变。

在您的公司的决策过程中引入人工智能不仅仅影响您自己，还会影响到您所在价值链和生态系统中的合作伙伴。

当我们考虑电力和计算机化的影响时，我们不会想到狭隘的应用；我们会想到变革。由于电力的存在，工厂不再需要位于水源附近并且有多层楼来优化蒸汽的使用。它们可以远离水源几百英里，分布在一层楼上，从而使新型的大规模生产系统成为可能。计算机也有同样的影响。它们从高级计算机器演变为史蒂夫·乔布斯所描述的“心灵的自行车”——而不是心灵的替代品。

这就是美洲杯给我们的真正启示。新西兰酋长队并没有将人排除出这一过程。当然，可以想象一个完全自动化的解决方案来做出每一个决定。但这种方法无疑很少见。AI预测提供了改善决策的信息，而这些决策是由人做出的。有趣的是，有了AI，不同之处不在于机器做得更多，而在于谁是最适合做出决策的人。

人工智能是如何改变决策的
当苹果公司推出智能手机革命时，没有人会认为这会对出租车行业造成威胁。但共享乘车之所以成为可能，是因为互联网连接的移动电话让人们能够通过应用程序叫车并以低廉的成本获取导航信息。例如，在伦敦，出租车司机需要三到四年的时间来熟悉城市的所有街道和最佳路线。如今，智能手机上的AI可以让任何人预测出到达目的地的最佳路线。

Investor: “What will your artificial intelligence do for businesses?”



Start-up founder: “It will give them insights.”

We wish we had a dime for every time an entrepreneur gave that answer to the mentors and investors at the Creative Destruction Lab, a global seed-stage start-up program we created at the University of Toronto.

Though it’s the stock response, “insights” is precisely the wrong way to think about how an advance in AI will create value. In fact, we feel that “insights” often is code for “We don’t know what to do with our AI’s predictions.”

A much better answer would be to describe the decisions that the predictions will improve, because AI has value only if it leads to better decision-making.

The good news for entrepreneurs is that the opportunities for AI to do that are countless. The number of decisions businesses make has been rising, and the need to make the right ones—in every area of operations—has never been greater. Consider that in 1960 just 6% of jobs required core decision-making skills such as problem-solving, diagnosing, strategizing, and prioritizing, according to research by David Deming of the Harvard Kennedy School. By 2018 that number had reached 34%.

But as we’ll show in the following pages, implementing AI isn’t just about improving specific decisions. Decisions in one area of an organization usually have an impact on decisions made in others, so introducing AI often entails revisiting and redesigning whole systems of decision-making. Let’s begin by looking at a specific example of an initiative where that was the case and how AI ended up completely changing the way the system involved created value.

How New Zealand Won the America’s Cup
Sailboat makers and sailors have been refining their techniques for 5,000 years. Even though commercial shipping no longer relies on wind for propulsion, innovations in sailing have never stopped.

The top prize in sailing (and the oldest trophy in international sports) is the America’s Cup. Today the race is as much about technology as about the skills of the crew. Millions of dollars go into boat design. Since the physics of wind, water, and ships are well understood, competitors use simulators to identify the most effective designs and to test boats without actually building them. The team with the best simulator gains a big advantage, as Emirates Team New Zealand discovered in 2017, when it won the cup.

Two decades after Edison switched on the light bulb, only 3% of U.S. businesses used electricity.

As the members of the team planned for the 2021 race, they wondered if they could speed up the design process. Partnering with McKinsey, the global consultancy, they identified the main bottleneck to innovation: human sailors. It takes time for a human crew to sail a boat in the simulator; there’s no way to increase the pace at which its members react to conditions and maneuver the boat in response. The sailors work on a human time scale, and that isn’t fast enough.

Using technology similar to the AI that beat the world’s top players of the popular strategy board game Go, the team taught an AI program to sail. The bot didn’t need to sleep or eat, and it could run thousands of simulations in the same time that it took the human crew to run just a handful. After eight weeks the AI started to beat the sailors in the simulator.

That’s when things got interesting. The AI began teaching the human sailors new tricks. As a member of the development team told Wired magazine, “The bot was actually doing things that felt counterintuitive to the sailors, but they’d try them out on the water and they’d actually work.” Previously, the boat designers had needed humans to test out any innovation. Figuring out the best way to use a newly designed boat could take weeks.

The AI, in contrast, could experiment with multiple variations of the boat simultaneously, 24 hours a day. It could try different racing tactics. It sped up the cycle of design itera-tion and the development of new maneuvers. Once the AI figured out a superior solution, the human sailors could copy it. As one team member put it, “Accelerating the learning process is extremely valuable, both in terms of allowing the design team to explore as much of the design space as possible and the sailors to maximize performance for a given design.” That year Emirates Team New Zealand claimed the trophy, winning seven races to three.

Why was this use of AI so novel? Setting aside the impressive technology that allowed for simulations in complex environments, the key impact was at the system level. The AI wasn’t handing Emirates Team New Zealand some insights. Instead, it was being built into a system of decision-making.


Inspired by his professional work in optical-modeling software and studies of optical aberrations, Ralf Jacobs combines 19th-century cyanotypes, digital harmonographs, and software-guided laser projections in his art to create an endless variety of intricate elliptical line drawings.
Race preparation involves two types of decisions: those about boat design and those about sailing maneuvers. While simulators had long been used for boat design, the maneuvers had always been worked out by humans. The AI didn’t actually pilot the boat in the race—the rules still require that real boats be piloted by real people—but it sped up the innovation process and allowed better coordination between boat design and sailing maneuvers. The complete system of the simulated boat and the AI sailor enabled improvements to both kinds of decisions.

Why System Change Takes Time
It can take a while for the systemic impact of a new technology to become apparent. When a technology emerges, people initially apply it narrowly. When electric power was invented as a substitute for steam power, for instance, businesses used it where the water needed for steam was hard to come by. Two decades after Edison switched on the light bulb, only 3% of U.S. businesses used electricity. Similarly, in 1987, decades after the introduction of computers into businesses, the economist Robert Solow noted, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” The potential of computing was clear, but the impact remained muted.

The same thing has happened with AI. Despite some alternative branding, new AI technologies are basically advances in statistics. They make it possible to predict more-multifaceted outcomes and, in doing so, take advantage of data that otherwise might be unexploited. And their initial applications were focused on what they could immediately deliver: better and cheaper predictions than humans were making.

Translation software, an early application of AI, is a good example. It predicts how people would translate a given text from one language to another on the basis of how real humans have translated previous texts. AI classifying medical images, another early application, predicted what expert radiologists would say that scans showed. Both applications leverage the wisdom of the crowd, which can often make far more accurate predictions than one person can. Applications like these can have enormous commercial value. Take the Canadian company Verafin, which was acquired by Nasdaq for $2.75 billion. Why? Because its AI-driven technologies for identifying financial fraud were being used by hundreds of financial institutions as a substitute for the security teams that used to perform that function.

These new applications may drive some important advances, but they’re hardly transformational. They slot into existing businesses without much fuss, precisely replacing the humans who traditionally made predictions. In all other respects, the businesses are unchanged.

The introduction of AI into your company’s decision-making doesn’t affect just you. It also affects your partners in the value chain and the ecosystem you operate in.

But when we consider the impact of electricity and computerization, we don’t think of narrow applications; we think of transformation. Thanks to electricity, factories no longer had to be located near water and have multiple stories to optimize the use of steam. They could be located hundreds of miles away from a water source and spread out on the same floor, making a new type of mass-production system feasible. Computers had the same impact. They evolved from being glorified calculating machines into what Steve Jobs described as “bicycles for the mind”—not substitutes for it.

And that’s the real lesson from the America’s Cup. Emirates Team New Zealand didn’t take the people out of the process. Yes, it is possible to imagine a fully automated solution that makes every decision. But that approach is surely a rarity. AI prediction provides information that improves decisions, which are made by people. Interestingly, with AI the difference is not so much whether machines do more but who the best people to make decisions are.

How AI Is Changing Decision-Making
When Apple launched the smartphone revolution, no one thought, It’s curtains for the taxi industry. But ride-sharing was possible only because internet-connected mobile phones allowed people to hail rides through an app and get navigation information cheaply. In London, for instance, it takes three to four years for cabdrivers to learn all the city’s streets and the best routes through them. Today AI on smartphones allows anyone to predict the best routes there,
