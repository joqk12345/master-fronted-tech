# title indigo最近一期blog感想

# chinese 
终于在两天挤出来了1个小时的时间听完了了indigo在油管上的最新一期的播客。我列一下我印象比较深刻的点：
1. 硅谷大佬的对代码的热爱，他举了google的sergey brin 作为google的早期创始人之一，隐居幕后多年现在出山成为gemini的core contributor，另一个例子是openai的前cto Greg Brockman
每周工作60到100小时，其中80%时间都在coding:
2. 美国与中国市场的ai差异：硅谷的 AI 创业更注重技术创新和基础架构建设；中国的 AI 创业更倾向于实用主义，快速找到应用场景并实现产品化；中国更注重从 1 到 100 的快速发展，而硅谷则从 0 到 1 的创新；
3. 做saas在日本市场的应用场景：做saas市场的一个日本的顶得上全部欧洲，日本用户对产品的忠诚度比较高可以容忍一些不好的体验、日本企业不好进但是终端市场的付费意愿都很高；

"I finally squeezed in an hour over two days to catch up with Indigo's latest podcast on YouTube. Here are the highlights that really stuck with me:

Silicon Valley's love affair with coding: The podcast highlighted Sergey Brin of Google as an example. Despite being one of the early founders, he stayed behind the scenes for years and now has resurfaced as a core contributor to Gemini. Another example is Greg Brockman, former CTO of OpenAI, who still dedicates 60 to 100 hours a week to work, with 80% of that time spent on coding.

The AI divide between the US and China: The approach to AI startups in Silicon Valley leans heavily towards technological innovation and infrastructure development. In contrast, Chinese AI startups are more pragmatic, quickly finding practical applications and moving towards productization. China focuses on scaling rapidly from 1 to 100, while Silicon Valley pioneers the 0 to 1 innovations.

The SaaS landscape in Japan: The Japanese SaaS market is so robust it could rival all of Europe. Japanese users are known for their product loyalty, often tolerating less-than-perfect user experiences. While it's tough to break into the Japanese corporate world, once you do, there's a high willingness to pay within the consumer market."
