命里有时终须有，命里无时莫强求。”这句话出自《增广贤文》，作者是清·周希陶。这句话的意思是：命里面要来的挡都挡不住，命里面没有的强求也是无济于事，什么都要随其自然

"There's a saying from a Chinese classic, 'Zengguang Xianwen', often attributed to Zhou Xitao from the Qing Dynasty. It goes, 'What's destined to come will come, and what's not, don't force it.' It means, things meant for you won't pass you by, and those not meant for you won't come, no matter how hard you try. Essentially, it's about going with the flow."
