# title : 通用智能与通用计算
# chinese

Alan Turing 发明了抽象版的计算机，我们现在称之为“图灵机”，然后他提出了一个证明，这个简单的机器可以计算任何东西 - 这就是 通用性计算。软件就是通用计算的产物，只有软件才能让最近一二十年来被炒作的 知识经济 成为可能。像比特一样，人们可以在不丢失自己的知识的情况下转移知识。然而知识经济的问题是，转移知识需要很长的时间，而且“复制”的知识很少与原来的知识一样。正因为如此，知识经济并不是一种富足的经济。事实上，公司经常抱怨知识的稀缺性，抱怨难以找到发展业务所急需的技术人才。

在未来的几十年里，我们可能会看到知识经济境况的转变，但这种知识将不需要人类，而是由机器（通过人工智能）来拥有和管理。可以在 Andreessen 的理论上增加第四点，人工智能将重新定义软件，或者叫智能（AGI - Artificial General Intelligence）将重写软件，那些需要人类丰富经验和专属化服务的行业也会被“富足化”，就像在“技术通缩”那里提到的教育和医疗。

Alan Turing invented the abstract concept of a computer, which we now call the "Turing machine." He then proposed a proof that this simple machine could compute anything—this is known as universal computation. Software is the product of universal computation, and it is what has made the knowledge economy, which has been hyped in recent decades, possible. Just like bitcoins, people can transfer knowledge without losing it. However, the problem with the knowledge economy is that transferring knowledge takes a long time, and the "copied" knowledge is rarely identical to the original. This is why the knowledge economy is not a prosperous one. In fact, companies often complain about the scarcity of knowledge and the difficulty of finding the technical talent they need to grow their businesses.

In the coming decades, we may witness a transformation in the state of the knowledge economy, but this knowledge will not be human-owned or managed. Instead, it will be owned and managed by machines through artificial intelligence. Building on Andreessen's theory, we can add a fourth point: artificial intelligence will redefine software, or rather, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will rewrite software. Industries that require human expertise and specialized services will also become "prosperous," just as education and healthcare were mentioned in the context of "technological deflation."
