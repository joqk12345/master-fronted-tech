# title 警惕医疗推销

# chinese 
每次去药店买药都会发现推销人员对你的心理拿捏的十分到位，往往会花更多的钱，比如最近一次给小乌龟看病买药，我想买一种眼药水，他以这种眼药水是处方药需要开处方以及这种药里有激素为由推荐了一种没有激素的更贵的药物，类似这种还有很多，总之去药店买药不要问他们，如果问了他们一定会给推荐贵的并且效果不一定好的药。

Every time I hit the pharmacy, the sales folks know just how to play me. I end up spending more cash, like when I took my turtle to get meds. I wanted this one eye drop, but they're like, "Nah, it's prescription-only and packed with steroids." So they pitch a pricier, steroid-free option. Stuff like this happens all the time. Moral of the story: Don't ask them for advice, or they'll upsell you on something expensive that might not even do the trick.
