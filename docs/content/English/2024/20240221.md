# title 节奏和韵律

# chinese 

节奏从本质上来讲是轻重缓急和适当停顿所决定的；而韵律是由音高和起伏所决定的。
节奏上出人意料的变化有将长元音和双元音读成更短的版本，很多辅音没有清楚的发音，很多实际存在的微妙停顿、可能在某些辅音之后加入了原本不存在的元音、常见的加音确实际上缺席了等等这种节奏上的变化最影响识别，而且经常说的语速不同主要不是慢了而是快了。

"Essentially, rhythm is determined by stress, speed, and appropriate pauses, while prosody is dictated by pitch and fluctuations.Unexpected variations in rhythm can include shortening long vowels and diphthongs, many consonants not being clearly pronounced, subtle pauses that actually exist, the addition of vowels after certain consonants where they don't originally belong, and common sounds that are actually absent. These rhythmic changes most significantly affect recognition, and the commonly referred to difference in speaking rate is not so much about being slower but rather faster."
