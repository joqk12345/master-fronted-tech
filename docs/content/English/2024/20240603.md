# title 现代教育体系的目标

# chinese 

这段内容进一步阐述了教育的目的应该是培养能够主动生产和组织生产的个体，而不仅仅是参与生产的合格成员。作者批评了现代教育体系，认为它导致大多数人在完成学业后缺乏判断力、创造性和独立生存的能力。教育应该帮助人们尽早开始生产，实现经济独立，这是独立生活的基础。

作者强调，学习应该是简单且直接的，目的是获取生产能力。每个人都天生具有消费能力，但需要通过学习来逐步获得生产能力。作者提倡主动学习和组织生产，而不是仅仅满足于参与生产。

此外，作者用电脑操作系统的比喻来说明个人知识体系的构成，包括清晰、准确、必要的概念以及这些概念之间的清晰、必要、准确的关联。作者认为，一个人的思考能力取决于他脑中概念的数量以及这些概念之间关联的清晰度。

总结提炼如下：
1. 教育应该培养能够主动生产和组织生产的个体。
2. 现代教育体系导致许多人缺乏判断力、创造性和独立生存能力。
3. 学习的目的是通过生产获取收益，实现经济独立。
4. 学习应该是简单且直接的，目的是获取生产能力。
5. 每个人都天生具有消费能力，需要通过学习来获得生产能力。
6. 提倡主动学习和组织生产，而不仅仅是参与生产。
7. 个人知识体系的构成类似于电脑操作系统，包括清晰、准确、必要的概念及其关联。
8. 一个人的思考能力取决于脑中概念的数量和概念间关联的清晰度。

The passage further elaborates on the purpose of education, which should be to cultivate individuals capable of active production and organizing production, rather than merely being qualified participants in production. The author criticizes the modern education system for leading to a lack of judgment, creativity, and the ability to survive independently in most individuals after completing their education. Education should help people start production early and achieve economic independence, which is the foundation for independent living.

The author emphasizes that learning should be simple and direct, with the purpose of acquiring productive capabilities. While everyone is naturally equipped with consumptive capabilities, the acquisition of productive capabilities needs to be gradually obtained through learning. The author advocates for active learning and organizing production, rather than settling for mere participation in production.

Furthermore, the author uses the analogy of a computer operating system to illustrate the composition of an individual's knowledge system, including clear, accurate, and necessary concepts, as well as the clear, necessary, and accurate connections between these concepts. The author believes that a person's thinking ability depends on the quantity of concepts in their mind and the clarity of the connections between these concepts.

In summary:
