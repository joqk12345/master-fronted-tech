# title : 语言模型的进化

# chinese 

语言是人类文明的火种，尤瓦尔·赫拉利在《人类简史》中写道，能够使用语言来协作和虚构故事是智人崛起的标志。
因此，要让机器像人类一样思考，实现通用人工智能（AGI），让机器理解和使用人类的语言，就是必经之路。

"Language is the spark of human civilization. Yuval Harari, in his book 'Sapiens', wrote that the ability to use language for cooperation and storytelling marked the rise of Homo sapiens. So, if we want machines to think like us, to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), they have to understand and use human language. It's a must-do on the road to AGI."
