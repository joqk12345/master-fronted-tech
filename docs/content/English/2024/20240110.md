人们对高管、首席执行官或庞大业务部门的领导者有不一样的憧憬。
他们认为，在那个级别的每个人都有足够的经验和智慧，至少看起来知道自己在做什么。
他们假定那里有深思熟虑、战略和长远思考，以及握手言和的合理交易。
但有些时候，它是高中；甚至有些时候，它是幼儿园。

People hold different expectations for top executives, CEOs, or leaders of massive business departments. They assume that everyone at that level has enough experience and wisdom, or at least appears to know what they're doing. They imagine a place of thoughtful deliberation, strategy, long-term thinking, and fair deals sealed with a handshake. But sometimes, it's more like high school; and even occasionally, it's akin to kindergarten.
