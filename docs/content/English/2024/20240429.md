# title 改变想法改变生活

# chinese 
每个人都会思考，也无法阻止自己思考, 思考会引发决策，而后带来行动，进而构成命运。于是人的命运都是自己思考才结果。
但是那些看起来无比复杂的思考，其基础不过是一个有一个简单的概念。所以，对那些
概念的理解，总是在暗中起到了决定性的作用。

We all think, can't help but do it. Thinking leads to decisions, then actions, shaping our destiny. So, our fate is a product of our thoughts. But those complex thoughts? They're just a stack of simple concepts. Understanding these concepts plays a crucial, often unseen, role in how things turn out.
