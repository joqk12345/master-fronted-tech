- 进取型人格他不会急于求成。他们看得见，也懂得努力与积累的作用，以及努力的重要性，那我经常说偷懒的最好方法就是不偷懒。懒这个东西是不敢偷的，因为你敢偷他，他就把你的未来偷光，他一出手手下绝不留情。一切急于求成的心态，都是缺乏积累的表现，都是曾经偷懒的结果。

A growth mindset doesn't rush for immediate success. Those with a growth mindset can see and understand the role of effort and accumulation, as well as the importance of hard work. So when I often say that the best way to avoid laziness is to not be lazy, it means that laziness is not something you can afford to indulge in. If you dare to be lazy, it will steal away your future without mercy. Any mindset that is focused on immediate results is a manifestation of a lack of accumulation, and it is the result of past laziness.
