《一本书的结构与内容概述》

这本书分为四个部分，它们分别解释了以下内容：

第一部分：仅有一章，阐述了 21 世纪以来青少年心理健康和幸福感的下降趋势相关的事实，展示了向以手机为基础的童年的迅速转变所带来的破坏性影响。心理健康的下降表现为焦虑、抑郁和自残发生率的急剧上升，这种情况从 21 世纪 10 年代初开始，女孩受到的影响最为严重。对于男孩来说，情况更为复杂。发生率的增长通常较小（自杀率除外），而且有时开始的时间稍早一些。

第二部分：讲述了背景故事。21 世纪 10 年代的心理健康危机源于 20 世纪 90 年代父母日益增长的恐惧和过度保护。本书展示了智能手机和过度保护是如何像“经验阻断器”一样起作用的，它们使得儿童和青少年难以获得他们最需要的具身社会经验，从有风险的玩耍、文化学徒经历到成人仪式和浪漫关系。

第三部分：呈现了研究成果，表明以手机为基础的童年在许多方面扰乱了儿童的发展。描述了四个基本危害：睡眠剥夺、社交剥夺、注意力分散和成瘾。然后聚焦于女孩，展示社交媒体的使用不仅仅与心理疾病相关，它还会导致心理疾病，并列出了实证证据来说明它导致心理疾病的多种方式。解释了男孩是如何通过稍微不同的途径陷入不良心理健康状况的。展示了大重构是如何导致男孩“未能成功步入成年”（即从青春期向成年期及其相关责任的过渡）发生率上升的。在第三部分的结尾，思考了以手机为基础的生活是如何在精神层面上改变我们所有人——儿童、青少年和成年人的。还讨论了六种古老的精神实践，它们可以帮助我们在今天生活得更好。

第四部分：阐述了我们现在能够并且必须做的事情。基于研究，为科技公司、政府、学校和家长提供了建议，以解决各种“集体行动问题”。这些是社会科学家长期研究的陷阱，在其中，个体单独行动面临高昂成本，但如果人们能够协调并共同行动，他们就能更容易地选择从长远来看对所有人都更有利的行动。

作为一名在纽约大学教授研究生和本科生课程，并在许多高中和大学发表演讲的教授，我发现 Z 世代有几个巨大的优势，这些优势将帮助他们推动积极的变革。首先，他们没有否认问题。他们想要变得更强大、更健康，而且大多数人对新的互动方式持开放态度。第二个优势是他们想要带来系统性的变革，以创造一个更公正、更关爱的世界，而且他们擅长组织起来实现这一目标（是的，他们利用社交媒体）。在过去的一年左右时间里，我听说越来越多的年轻人开始关注科技行业对他们的剥削方式。随着他们组织起来并进行创新，他们将找到超越本书所提出的新解决方案，并使其成为现实。

among adolescents since 2010 (part 1); the nature of childhood and how we
messed it up (part 2); the harms that result from the new phone-based
childhood (part 3); and what we must do now to reverse the damage in our
families, schools, and societies (part 4). Change is possible, if we can act
together.
Part 1 has a single chapter laying out the facts about the decline in teen
mental health and wellbeing in the 21st century, showing how devastating
the rapid switch to a phone-based childhood has been. The decline in
mental health is indicated by a sharp rise in rates of anxiety, depression, and
self-harm, beginning in the early 2010s, which hit girls hardest. For boys,
the story is more complicated. The increases are often smaller (except for
suicide rates), and they sometimes begin a bit earlier.
Part 2 gives the backstory. The mental health crisis of the 2010s has its
roots in the rising parental fearfulness and overprotection of the 1990s. I
show how smartphones, along with overprotection, acted like “experience
blockers,” which made it difficult for children and adolescents to get the
embodied social experiences they needed most, from risky play and cultural
apprenticeships to rites of passage and romantic attachments.
In part 3, I present research showing that a phone-based childhood
disrupts child development in many ways. I describe four foundational
harms: sleep deprivation, social deprivation, attention fragmentation, and
addiction. I then zoom in on girls[*] to show that social media use does not
just correlate with mental illness; it causes it, and I lay out the empirical
evidence showing multiple ways that it does so. I explain how boys came to
their poor mental health by a slightly different route. I show how the Great
Rewiring contributed to their rising rates of “failure to launch”—that is, to
make the transition from adolescence to adulthood and its associated
responsibilities. I close part 3 with reflections on how a phone-based life
changes us all—children, adolescents, and adults—by bringing us “down”
on what I can only describe as a spiritual dimension. I discuss six ancient
spiritual practices that can help us all live better today.
In part 4, I lay out what we can and must do now. I offer advice, based
on research, for what tech companies, governments, schools, and parents
can do to break out of a variety of “collective action problems.” These are
traps long studied by social scientists in which an individual acting alone
faces high costs, but if people can coordinate and act together, they can
more easily choose actions that are better for all in the long run.
As a professor at New York University who teaches graduate and
undergraduate courses, and who speaks at many high schools and colleges,
I have found that Gen Z has several great strengths that will help them drive
positive change. The first is that they are not in denial. They want to get
stronger and healthier, and most are open to new ways of interacting. The
second strength is that they want to bring about systemic change to create a
more just and caring world, and they are adept at organizing to do so (yes,
using social media). In the last year or so, I’ve been hearing about an
increasing number of young people who are turning their attention to the
ways the tech industry exploits them. As they organize and innovate, they’ll
find new solutions beyond those I propose in this book, and they’ll make
them happen.
