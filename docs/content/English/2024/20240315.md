# title 元素之间的逻辑关系

# chinese 

元素是指一切可以摆在一起的东西。可能是两三个词汇，可能是两三个句子，也可能是两三个段落，可能是两三个理由，也可能是两三个陈述，甚至可能是两三个章节。不管它是元素还是词汇还是段落还是句子还是理由，反正这些能够摆在一起的元素之间，相互可以形成的逻辑关系，事实上很少，一共就只有三种。要么它们之间并列，要么它们之间递进，要么它们之间转折。

Elements refer to anything that can be put together, whether it's a couple of words, a few sentences, a handful of paragraphs, a couple of reasons, a few statements, or even a couple of chapters. Regardless of whether they're elements, vocabulary, paragraphs, sentences, or reasons, the truth is there are only three main logical relationships that can exist between these combinable elements. They either stand side by side, progress step by step, or clash head-on. And that's the deal, my friend.
