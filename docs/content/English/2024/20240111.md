 数字重塑人生的三大表现， AI领域人类知识的数字化、加密世界身份资产的数字化、Metaverse - 物理世界的数学化， 软件是这次人类数字化的核心，它是现实世界的杠杆，能将比特转化为实际的应用来解决复杂问题，它是我们这个时代最接近魔法的东西。去年中写得《数宇重塑人生》现在来看感觉很超前 还颇具现实意义

 Three major ways digitalization is reshaping life include the digitization of human knowledge in the AI field, the digitization of identity assets in the crypto world, and the mathematical representation of the physical world in the Metaverse. Software is at the heart of this digital transformation. It's a lever in the real world, capable of turning bits into practical applications to solve complex problems. It's the closest thing to magic in our era. Looking back at my piece Digitalization Reshaping Life written last year, it feels quite ahead of its time and still holds significant relevance today.
