# title 输入为本

# chinese 

创作的本质就是输入加上处理等于输出。因为创意这个东西就那么一点点，剩下的全都是格式化，就如一杯咖啡里最多的成分其实是水而不是咖啡一样。但是往往很多人的输入设备往往是坏的，更多的情况是大多数人的输入设备虽然是好的但形同虚设。更多的是输入设备与处理设备无连接。还有更多的人的处理设备坏了确不自知。

"The essence of creation is input plus processing equals output. Because creativity is just a tiny part of it, the rest is all about formatting, much like the biggest ingredient in a cup of coffee is actually water, not coffee. However, many people's input devices are often broken, or more often, they have good input devices that are virtually unused. More often than not, there's no connection between the input and processing devices. And even more people have broken processing devices without realizing it."
