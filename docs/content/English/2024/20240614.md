# title 学习的本质

# chinese 

这段内容主要讨论了学习的本质、语言文字的重要性以及扫盲工作的挑战。以下是对这段内容的总结和提炼：

1. **学习的本质**：作者再次强调学习其实是简单的，特别是对于已经识字或语文基础完善的人来说，学习不过是认真阅读说明书而已。

2. **识字的挑战**：识字并不简单，人类发明文字约有5000年历史，但消灭文盲仍是许多民族和国家尚未完成的任务。

3. **犹太民族的扫盲**：可能是第一个消灭文盲的民族，通过宗教排除法完成扫盲，通过教育费用的承担来维持信仰。

4. **朝鲜王朝的扫盲**：可能是第一个消灭文盲的国家，通过发明朝鲜文字（燕文或Hangeul），一种拼音文字，简单到全国上下都能快速学会。

5. **全球扫盲现状**：20世纪20年代，美国的文盲比例高达30%以上；1949年，中华人民共和国成立时，文盲比例超过80%；直到2010年，中国大陆文盲率降至4.08%。

6. **现代教育体系的贡献**：作者虽然对现代教育体系有所批评，但承认其在扫盲工作上的贡献是难以替代的。

7. **中文扫盲的困难**：中文扫盲尤其困难，因为3000常用汉字相当于全部规则，中文字典的查阅比英文费劲。

8. **识字与知识的关系**：识字本身不够，需要与有效的知识结合才能起作用。文字是绘画的工具，作画还需要表达清晰的思想。

9. **语言的复杂性**：语言文字的复杂性不仅在于识字，还在于理解每个字、词在不同语境下的不同意思，尤其是抽象词汇。

通过这段内容，作者传达了一个核心观点：尽管现代教育体系存在不足，但其在基础扫盲教育上取得了显著成就。同时，作者也强调了识字和语言学习的重要性，以及深入理解和应用语言的复杂性。此外，作者提醒读者，学习可以是简单的过程，但需要正确的方法和对语言的深刻理解。

The main focus of this passage is the nature of learning, the importance of language and writing, and the challenges of literacy efforts. Here is a summary and extraction of the key points from this passage:

The essence of learning: The author emphasizes again that learning is actually simple, especially for those who are already literate or have a solid foundation in language. Learning is merely a matter of reading instructions carefully.

Challenges of literacy: Literacy is not easy. Although humans have invented writing for about 5,000 years, eradicating illiteracy remains an unfinished task for many nations and countries.

Literacy efforts of the Jewish people: They were possibly the first to eradicate illiteracy, using religious exclusion to achieve literacy and maintaining their faith through the burden of educational expenses.

Literacy efforts of the Joseon Dynasty: They were possibly the first country to eradicate illiteracy, inventing the Korean script (Hangeul), a phonetic alphabet that was simple enough for the entire nation to learn quickly.

Global literacy status: In the 1920s, the illiteracy rate in the United States was over 30%. When the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, the illiteracy rate exceeded 80%. It was not until 2010 that the illiteracy rate on the Chinese mainland dropped to 4.08%.

Contributions of the modern education system: While the author criticizes the modern education system, they acknowledge its irreplaceable contributions to literacy efforts.

Difficulties of Chinese literacy: Chinese literacy is particularly challenging because the 3,000 commonly used Chinese characters represent the entire set of rules, and looking up characters in a Chinese dictionary is more laborious than in English.

Relationship between literacy and knowledge: Literacy alone is not enough; it needs to be combined with effective knowledge to be effective. Writing is a tool for drawing, and drawing requires clear expression of thoughts.

Complexity of language: The complexity of language and writing lies not only in literacy but also in understanding the different meanings of each character and word in different contexts, especially abstract vocabulary.

Through this passage, the author conveys a core point: despite the shortcomings of the modern education system, it has made significant achievements in basic literacy education. At the same time, the author emphasizes the importance of literacy and language learning, as well as a deep understanding and application of the complexity of language. Additionally, the author reminds readers that learning can be a simple process, but it requires the right methods and a profound understanding of language.
