# title 生产为导向的隐秘好处

# chinese 
生产为导向的隐秘的好处 它会自动消灭很多坏习惯啊，比如攀比，比如炫耀，比如嫉妒等等。原因是，首先是因为具备系统观念的人要做的事情更多。并且可能还要多出很多。其次，是因为具备系统观念的人看到别人作品好的时候，更多的肯定是去研究的欲望，而非其他。当然了，最为关键的是因为只有具备系统观念的人才可能有作品。

The hidden benefit of a production-oriented approach is that it automatically eradicates many bad habits, like comparison, bragging, envy, and so on. The reason is, firstly, people with a systemic mindset have more to do, often a lot more. Secondly, when they see someone else's good work, their primary impulse is to study it, not anything else. And crucially, only those with a systemic mindset are likely to produce work of their own.
