# title 什么才是家庭建设

# chinese 

作者在这段对话中进一步强调了孩子在家庭建设中的重要性。他认为，只有在孩子出生之后，才有真正的家庭建设，否则就只是两个人一起过日子。他提到，他们夫妻之间至少有一件必须做成的事情，那就是把孩子养大成人。明确了这个目标之后，他们的关系变得更为亲密。

作者总结了这节课的关键词：关系、长期、信誉、负责、共同成长、终生发展、共同目标。他挑战了传统的教育观念，认为这些关键词是父母需要以身作则，亲力亲为的，而不是可以在名校或者贵族学校中获得的。

作者并不否认读什么专业、上什么学校、从事什么工种的重要性，但他认为，与上述关键词相比，这些因素并不那么重要。他认为，家庭的关系、长期的承诺、信誉的建立、负责任的态度、共同的成长和目标，以及终生的发展，比子女的专业、学校和工种更重要。

总的来说，作者在这段对话中强调了家庭关系的重要性，以及父母在孩子的成长过程中的角色和责任。他认为，这些因素比传统的教育因素更重要，也更能影响孩子的成长和发展。

The author further emphasizes the importance of children in family building. They believe that true family building only begins after a child is born; otherwise, it's just two people living together. They mention that there's at least one thing they must accomplish as a couple, which is to raise their child to adulthood. With this goal clarified, their relationship becomes closer.

The author summarizes the keywords of this lesson: relationships, long-term, trust, responsibility, growing together, lifelong development, common goals. They challenge traditional educational concepts, believing that these keywords are things parents need to exemplify and personally act upon, not things that can be obtained from elite or private schools.

The author doesn't deny the importance of what major to study, which school to attend, or what job to take up, but they believe that compared to the aforementioned keywords, these factors aren't as crucial. They think relationships within the family, long-term commitments, trust-building, responsible attitudes, common growth and goals, and lifelong development are more important than a child's major, school, and job type.

In summary, the author emphasizes the importance of family relationships and the role and responsibility of parents in a child's growth process in this conversation. They believe these factors are more important than traditional educational factors and have a greater impact on a child's growth and development.
