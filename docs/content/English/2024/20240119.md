现在的经济体系不是为一个由技术驱动、价格不断下降的世界而建立的，它是为工业时代建立的，当时劳动和资本密不可分，这是一个依靠增长和通货膨胀的时代，一个我们从稀缺和低效中赚钱的时代。那个时代已经过去了，但我们一直在假装那些经济体系仍然有效。大多数发达资本主义国家的中央银行都以 2% 的通胀为目标，刺激经济的发展，现在看来政治意义大于实际意义。

"The current economic system wasn't built for a world driven by technology where prices keep falling. It was built for the industrial age, a time when labor and capital were inseparable, an era that thrived on growth and inflation, a time when we made money from scarcity and inefficiency. That era is over, but we keep pretending those old systems still work. Most central banks in developed capitalist countries target a 2% inflation rate to stimulate economic growth, but it appears to be more of a political gesture than a practical one now."
