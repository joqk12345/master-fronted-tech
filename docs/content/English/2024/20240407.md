# title 论证穿过表象看本质的论据

# chinese 

- 一个极为经典，确精确的论证依据，穿过表现看实质究竟是多么简单，多么重要，并且最终导致的结果差异有多么的惊人。
- 固守型人格与这个进取型人格之间呢，其实是有很多差异的，但是呢，从本质上来看。最初的时候仅仅是一个选择。选择自己与自己的过去，或者是现在的自己与未来的自己，这种纵向的比较。而非现在的自己与现在的他人这种横向的比较。这就好像是从一个点出发的两条直线，刚开始只是一点点的差异，随着两条直线的延伸，最终呢？天壤之别就是这样产生了。

- It is indeed a classic and precise argument that highlights the simplicity and importance of looking beyond appearances to understand the essence, ultimately leading to astonishing differences in outcomes.
- There are indeed many differences between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset, but fundamentally, it all starts with a choice. It's a choice between oneself and one's past, or between one's present self and one's future self—a vertical comparison, rather than a horizontal one between one's present self and others. It's like two straight lines starting from a single point, with initially minor differences. However, as these lines extend, the stark contrast between them becomes evident, creating a world of difference.

evident / ˈevɪdənt / adj.  清楚的，显然的
stark / stɑːrk / adj.  荒凉的；严酷的；明显的，鲜明的；完全的，十足的；健壮的，结实的
