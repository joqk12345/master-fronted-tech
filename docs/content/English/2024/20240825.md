《一位社会心理学家对青少年心理健康研究的历程》

我是一名社会心理学家，而非临床心理学家或媒体研究学者。但青少年心理健康的崩溃是一个紧迫而复杂的话题，我们无法仅从单一学科的视角去理解它。我研究道德、情感和文化。在此过程中，我获得了一些工具和视角，我将把它们应用于儿童发展和青少年心理健康的研究中。

自 20 世纪 90 年代末积极心理学诞生以来，我就一直活跃在这个领域，沉浸在对幸福成因的研究中。我的第一本书《幸福的假设》审视了东西方古代文化所发现的关于如何过上美好生活的 10 个“伟大真理”。基于那本书，我在弗吉尼亚大学担任心理学教授期间（直到 2011 年）教授了一门名为《蓬勃发展》的课程，现在我在纽约大学斯特恩商学院为本科生和工商管理硕士学生教授这门课程的不同版本。随着我的学生从使用翻盖手机的千禧一代变为使用智能手机的 Z 世代，我看到了焦虑水平的上升和设备成瘾现象。我从他们坦率地讨论自己的心理健康挑战以及他们与科技的复杂关系中学到了很多。

我的第二本书《正义之心》阐述了我自己对道德进化心理基础的研究。我探究了好人为何会因政治和宗教而产生分歧，特别关注人们融入道德社群的需求，因为这些社群能给予他们一种共同的意义和目的感。这项工作让我明白，虽然在线社交网络对帮助成年人实现目标可能有用，但对于儿童来说，它可能无法有效地替代他们数十万年以来一直扎根、成长和受教育其中的现实世界社群。

但正是我的第三本书让我直接投身于青少年心理健康的研究。我的朋友格雷格·卢基安诺夫是最早注意到大学校园里发生突变的人之一，因为学生们开始出现格雷格在 2007 年经历严重抑郁发作后学习认知行为疗法（CBT）时学会识别和摒弃的那种扭曲思维模式。格雷格是一名律师，也是个人权利与表达基金会的主席，该基金会长期以来一直在帮助学生捍卫自己的权利，对抗那些吹毛求疵的校园管理者。2014 年，他看到了奇怪的事情发生：学生们自己开始要求大学保护他们免受那些让他们感到“不安全”的书籍和演讲者的影响。格雷格认为，大学在某种程度上正在无意中教导学生陷入诸如灾难化、非黑即白思维和情绪化推理等认知扭曲，而这实际上可能导致学生变得抑郁和焦虑。2015 年 8 月，我们在《大西洋月刊》上发表了一篇题为《美国思维的娇惯》的文章提出了这一观点。

我们只对了一部分：一些大学课程和新的学术趋势确实在无意中教授了认知扭曲。但到 2017 年，很明显，抑郁和焦虑的增加正在许多国家发生在所有教育水平、社会阶层和种族的青少年身上。平均而言，1996 年及以后出生的人与仅仅早出生几年的人在心理上有所不同。

我们决定把我们在《大西洋月刊》上的文章扩展成一本同名的书。在书中，我们借鉴珍·特文格 2017 年的书《i 世代》分析了这场心理健康危机的成因。然而，当时几乎所有的证据都是相关性的：青少年一拿到 iPhone 就开始变得更抑郁。使用最频繁的人也是最抑郁的，而那些花更多时间参加面对面活动（比如参加运动队和宗教团体）的人是最健康的。但鉴于相关性并不能证明因果关系，我们提醒家长不要基于现有的研究就采取激烈的行动。

现在，在 2023 年我写作的时候，有了更多的研究——既有实验性的也有相关性的——表明社交媒体正在伤害青少年，尤其是处于青春期的女孩。在为这本书进行研究的过程中，我还发现，问题的成因比我最初想象的更广泛。这不仅仅关乎智能手机和社交媒体；这是关于人类童年的一次历史性和前所未有的转变。这种转变对男孩和女孩的影响同样巨大。

I amasocialpsychologist, notaclinicalpsychologistoramedia
studies scholar. But the collapse of adolescent mental health is an urgent
and complex topic that we can’t understand from any one disciplinary
perspective. I study morality, emotion, and culture. Along the way I’ve
picked up some tools and perspectives that I’ll bring to the study of child
development and adolescent mental health.
I have been active in the field of positive psychology since its birth in
the late 1990s, immersed in research on the causes of happiness. My first
book, The Happiness Hypothesis, examines 10 “great truths” that ancient
cultures East and West discovered about how to live a flourishing life.
Based on that book, I taught a course called Flourishing when I was a
professor of psychology at the University of Virginia (until 2011), and I
teach versions of it now at NYU’s Stern School of Business, to
undergraduates and to MBA students. I have seen the rising levels of
anxiety and device addiction as my students have changed from millennials
using flip phones to Gen Z using smartphones. I have learned from their
candor in discussing their mental health challenges and their complex
relationships with technology.
My second book, The Righteous Mind, lays out my own research on the
evolved psychological foundations of morality. I explore the reasons why
good people are divided by politics and religion, paying special attention to
people’s needs to be bound into moral communities that give them a sense
of shared meaning and purpose. This work prepared me to see how online
social networks, which can be useful for helping adults achieve their goals,
may not be effective substitutes for real-world communities within which
children have been rooted, shaped, and raised for hundreds of thousands of
years.
But it was my third book that led me directly to the study of adolescent
mental health. My friend Greg Lukianoff was among the first to notice that
something had changed very suddenly on college campuses as students
began engaging in exactly the distorted thinking patterns that Greg had
learned to identify and reject when he learned CBT (cognitive behavioral
therapy) after a severe episode of depression in 2007. Greg is a lawyer and
the president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which
has long helped students defend their rights against censorious campus
administrators. In 2014, he saw something strange happening: Students
themselves began demanding that colleges protect them from books and
speakers that made them feel “unsafe.” Greg thought that universities were
somehow teaching students to engage in cognitive distortions such as
catastrophizing, black-and-white thinking, and emotional reasoning, and
that this could actually be causing students to become depressed and
anxious. In August 2015, we presented this idea in an Atlantic essay titled
“The Coddling of the American Mind.”
We were only partially correct: Some college courses and new
academic trends[14] were indeed inadvertently teaching cognitive
distortions. But by 2017 it had become clear that the rise of depression and
anxiety was happening in many countries, to adolescents of all educational
levels, social classes, and races. On average, people born in and after 1996
were different, psychologically, from those who had been born just a few
years earlier.
We decided to expand our Atlantic article into a book with the same
title. In it, we analyzed the causes of this mental illness crisis, drawing on
Jean Twenge’s 2017 book, iGen. At the time, however, nearly all evidence
was correlational: Soon after teens got iPhones, they started getting more
depressed. The heaviest users were also the most depressed, while those
who spent more time in face-to-face activities, such as on sports teams and
in religious communities, were the healthiest.[15] But given that correlation
is not proof of causation, we cautioned parents not to take drastic action on
the basis of existing research.
Now, as I write in 2023, there’s a lot more research—experimental as
well as correlational—showing that social media harms adolescents,
especially girls going through puberty.
[16] I have also discovered, while
doing the research for this book, that the causes of the problem are broader
than I had initially thought. It’s not just about smartphones and social
media; it’s about a historic and unprecedented transformation of human
childhood. The transformation is affecting boys as much as girls
