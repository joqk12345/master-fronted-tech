说好的教育，好的家庭教育都是要以生产为导向的。那在学习的真相里我们又阐述了生产需要复合技能，我们去讲教练的真相，我们要进一步补充生产是一个系统工程。那事实上呢，一切有意义的活动都是系统工程。这就是普遍现象背后的机理。只有通才才能够组织生产，这个专才最多只能参与生产。

Good education, including home education, should always be production-oriented. In the truth of learning, we've discussed that production requires a mix of skills. In discussing the truth about coaching, we need to further emphasize that production is a systematic process. In fact, all meaningful activities are systematic. That's the mechanism behind the universal phenomenon. Only a well-rounded person can organize production, while a specialist can at most participate in it.
