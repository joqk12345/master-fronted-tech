# title 现代教育体系剖析

# chinese 

这段内容主要探讨了现代教育体系的起源、目的和存在的问题，并提出了家庭教育应该以生产为核心，而不是仅仅成为被组织者的观点。以下是对这段内容的总结和提炼：

1. **现代教育体系的起源**：现代教育体系是由工业革命刺激出来的，其最初的核心作用是培养工业时代所需的劳动力。

2. **教育体系的目的**：现代教育体系的目标是为社会提供合格的劳动力，包括九年义务教育、大学、研究院、职业学校等。

3. **教育体系的弊端**：教育体系主要关注能快速衡量学习效果的领域，侧重于客观题和标准化测试，而不是实际生活和工作中需要的主观判断和决策能力。

4. **社会对劳动力的需求**：社会对合格劳动力的需求是无限的，但对领导者和组织者的需求实际上越来越少。

5. **家庭教育的核心**：家庭教育应该以生产为核心，培养子女成为能够独立生产、能够组织和领导的个体。

6. **对学校教育的态度**：家长不应过分重视学校教育和子女的学习成绩，因为这些并不决定子女的人生。

7. **学习的新定义**：学习不应该仅限于学校课堂内，而是应该在课前完成，上课更像是复习和讨论。

8. **成功与教育**：真正的成功者是少数，跟随大多数人的方法不可能成为成功的极少数，因此需要探究更重要的原则。

9. **教育与社会需求**：现代教育体系是由社会需求决定的，而不是为了培养领导者和组织者。

10. **对子女的期望**：作者提出了自己对子女的低期望值，强调不要掉队，但不必追求名次，真正的学习和教育是在生活中不断进行的。

作者通过这段内容传达了对现代教育体系的批判性看法，并强调了家庭教育在培养子女成为独立思考、能够生产和组织的个体中的重要性。同时，作者也提出了对学校教育成绩的相对轻视，鼓励家长从更广阔的视角来看待教育和学习。

The passage primarily explores the origins, purposes, and issues with the modern education system, and proposes that family education should revolve around production rather than merely becoming organized individuals. Here is a summary and extraction of the key points:

Origin of the modern education system: The modern education system emerged as a response to the Industrial Revolution, initially aimed at producing the workforce needed for the industrial era.

Purpose of the education system: The goal of the modern education system is to provide society with qualified labor, including compulsory education, universities, research institutes, vocational schools, etc.

Shortcomings of the education system: The education system primarily focuses on areas that can be quickly measured, emphasizing objective questions and standardized testing, rather than subjective judgment and decision-making skills needed in real-life and work situations.

Society's demand for labor: Society's demand for qualified labor is infinite, but the demand for leaders and organizers is actually decreasing.

Core of family education: Family education should revolve around production, cultivating children to become independent producers, organizers, and leaders.

Attitude towards school education: Parents should not overly prioritize school education and their children's academic performance, as these do not determine their children's lives.

A new definition of learning: Learning should not be confined to the classroom but should be completed before class, with class time serving as a review and discussion.

Success and education: True success is for a minority, and following the methods of the majority cannot lead to exceptional success. Therefore, it is necessary to explore more important principles.

Education and societal demand: The modern education system is determined by societal demand, not for the purpose of cultivating leaders and organizers.

Expectations for children: The author expresses low expectations for their children, emphasizing the importance of not falling behind but not pursuing rankings. True learning and education occur continuously in life.

Through this passage, the author conveys a critical view of the modern education system and emphasizes the importance of family education in cultivating children as independent thinkers, producers, and organizers. Additionally, the author devalues the significance of school education grades and encourages parents to approach education and learning from a broader perspective.
