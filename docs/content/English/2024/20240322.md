# title 什么是锦/什么是好内容

# chinese 

当我们看到有些文字震撼我们心灵的时候，永远不是文采在起作用，它顶多是锦上添花，看到文字传递的思想或者我们平日里称为内容的东西，或者是逻辑框架核心逻辑框架的东西才是真正的“锦”

# english
When words really rock our world, it's never just about the flair. That's just the cherry on top. It's the ideas, the meat of the matter, that really count. Or the backbone of logic that holds it all together – that's the real deal. So, it's the guts of the message and the solid framework we should dig into, not the fancy wrapping.
