只要资本家找到方法让人们为这种快乐买单，这也意味着更多的 GDP。科技巨头们正努力把互联网升级成为体验更加真实，连接更加实时的 Metaverse，让它包围你的生活，不管你愿意还是不愿意，它都会来到你身边，占据你的感官和所有的时间。你会在非物质化的环境里面购买商品，产生交易；也可以在这里配置新的数字商品，用新的代码和软件，而不是物理世界的金属和能源，当然也能减少碳排放。这是让 Mark Zuckerberg 有勇气把公司全面转型到 Metaverse 的必然趋势，也是让的 GDP 能继续稳定增长的方法。

As long as capitalists find ways to make people pay for this kind of happiness, it also means more GDP. Tech giants are working hard to upgrade the internet into a more immersive and real-time experience called the Metaverse. It will surround your life, whether you like it or not, occupying your senses and all of your time. You will be able to purchase goods in this intangible environment, generating transactions. You can also create and customize new digital products using new code and software, rather than relying on physical-world metals and energy, which, of course, helps reduce carbon emissions. This inevitable trend gives Mark Zuckerberg the courage to fully transition his company to the Metaverse and provides a way for GDP to continue its steady growth.
