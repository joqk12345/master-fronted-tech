# title 超额学习的重要性

# chinese 

节能倾向与学习标准： 大脑的节能倾向导致人们倾向于按需学习，但提高学习标准可以对抗这一倾向。

循环利用机制： 大脑中的学习活动涉及神经元之间的连接，这些连接一旦建立，大脑会倾向于循环利用而非废弃，即使连接不再被使用。

学习与神经连接： 学习导致大脑中神经元连接的增加，这些连接越多，人的认知能力越强。

早期学习的重要性： 早期学习有助于建立更多的神经元连接，对未来的学习和认知能力有积极影响。

超额学习的价值： 超额学习可以创建更强的神经连接，这些连接在未来更容易被循环利用，从而提高学习效率。

学习的终极建议： 根据大脑的机制，学习的建议是多多益善，无论是学习的内容还是练习的次数，都应该尽可能多。

学习的副作用： 按需学习和循环利用机制都有其副作用，但通过超额学习，可以转化这些副作用为学习的优势。

生理学角度的学习意义： 从生理学角度看，学习的意义在于建立更多的神经元连接，这些连接是智力和能力的基础。

大脑的天然需求： 节能是大脑的天然需求，通过了解这一点，我们可以更有意识地制定学习策略。

学习的生理和心理效益： 学习不仅在心理上给人带来成就感，其生理效益也不容忽视，特别是在提高大脑功能方面。

这段文字强调了大脑的节能倾向对学习行为的影响，并提出了超额学习作为一种有效的学习策略，以对抗大脑的节能倾向，促进更有效的学习和认知发展。

Energy-saving tendencies and learning standards: The brain's energy-saving tendencies lead people to prefer learning on-demand, but raising learning standards can counteract this tendency.

Mechanism of recycling: Learning activities in the brain involve connections between neurons, and once these connections are established, the brain tends to recycle them rather than discard them, even if they are no longer used.

Learning and neural connections: Learning leads to an increase in neural connections in the brain, and the more connections there are, the stronger a person's cognitive abilities.

The importance of early learning: Early learning helps establish more neural connections, which positively impact future learning and cognitive abilities.

The value of overlearning: Overlearning can create stronger neural connections that are more easily recycled in the future, thus improving learning efficiency.

The ultimate advice for learning: Based on the brain's mechanisms, the advice for learning is that more is better, both in terms of the content learned and the number of practice repetitions.

Side effects of learning: On-demand learning and the mechanism of recycling have their side effects, but through overlearning, these side effects can be transformed into advantages for learning.

The physiological significance of learning: From a physiological perspective, the significance of learning lies in establishing more neural connections, which form the foundation of intelligence and abilities.

The brain's natural demand: Energy-saving is a natural demand of the brain, and by understanding this, we can consciously develop learning strategies.

The physiological and psychological benefits of learning: Learning not only brings a sense of achievement on a psychological level but also has significant physiological benefits, especially in improving brain function.

This passage emphasizes the impact of the brain's energy-saving tendencies on learning behavior and proposes overlearning as an effective learning strategy to counteract these tendencies and promote more efficient learning and cognitive development.
