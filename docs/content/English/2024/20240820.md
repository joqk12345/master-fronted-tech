# title 《科技发展的双刃剑：科技公司对儿童的影响与监管反思》

# chinese 

在千禧年之交，美国西海岸的科技公司借助迅速发展的互联网创造出了一系列改变世界的产品。当时人们普遍持有科技乐观主义的态度，这些产品让生活变得更便捷、更有趣、更富有成效。其中一些产品帮助人们建立联系和沟通，似乎对日益增多的新兴民主国家是一种福祉。在铁幕落下后不久，仿佛一个新时代的黎明降临。这些公司的创始人被誉为英雄、天才和全球的恩人，如同普罗米修斯般为人类带来了神的礼物。

然而，科技行业不仅改变了成年人的生活，也开始改变儿童的生活。自 20 世纪 50 年代以来，儿童和青少年就一直在看电视，但新的科技产品比以往任何事物都更便携、更个性化、更具吸引力。早在 2008 年，我就发现了这一事实，当时我两岁的儿子掌握了我的第一部 iPhone 的触摸和滑动界面，许多父母也早早意识到了这一点。许多父母欣慰地发现智能手机或平板电脑能让孩子开心地沉浸其中并安静数小时。但这真的安全吗？没人知道答案，只是因为其他人都在这么做，大家就都认为应该没问题。

然而，这些公司对其产品对儿童和青少年心理健康的影响几乎没有或完全没有进行研究，也没有与研究健康影响的研究人员分享数据。当面对越来越多表明其产品正在伤害年轻人的证据时，他们大多采取否认、混淆视听和开展公关活动的策略。那些通过心理技巧来最大化“用户参与度”以让年轻人不断点击的公司是最恶劣的违规者。他们在儿童大脑发育的脆弱阶段吸引住孩子们，此时孩子们的大脑正因接收的刺激而迅速重新布线。这其中包括对女孩伤害最大的社交媒体公司，以及对男孩影响最深的电子游戏公司和色情网站。通过设计大量令人上瘾的内容像消防水龙一样进入孩子们的耳目，取代了身体活动和面对面的社交活动，这些公司重塑了童年，在几乎难以想象的规模上改变了人类的发展。这种重塑最激烈的时期是 2010 年至 2015 年，不过故事要从 20 世纪 80 年代令人担忧的过度保护型育儿方式的兴起说起，一直持续到当下的新冠疫情时期。

到目前为止，我们对这些科技公司施加了哪些法律限制呢？在美国，它最终为大多数其他国家设定了规范，主要的禁令是 1998 年颁布的《儿童在线隐私保护法》（COPPA）。它要求 13 岁以下的儿童在与公司签订合同（服务条款）以放弃他们的数据和部分权利来开设账户之前，必须获得父母的同意。出于与儿童安全或心理健康几乎无关的原因，这将“互联网成年”的有效年龄设定为 13 岁。但法律措辞并不要求公司核实年龄；只要孩子勾选一个框声称自己年龄够大（或者输入正确的假生日），她就可以在父母不知情或不同意的情况下几乎可以访问互联网上的任何地方。事实上，40%的 13 岁以下的美国儿童已经创建了 Instagram 账户，但自 1998 年以来联邦法律一直没有更新。（另一方面，英国已经采取了一些初步措施，美国的一些州也是如此。）

一些科技公司的行为就像烟草和电子烟行业一样，这些行业将其产品设计得极具成瘾性，然后逃避限制向未成年人营销的法律。我们也可以将它们与反对禁止含铅汽油的石油公司相提并论。在 20 世纪中叶，有证据开始不断增加，仅美国司机每年排放到大气中的数十万吨铅就正在干扰数千万儿童的大脑发育，损害他们的认知发展并增加反社会行为的发生率。即便如此，石油公司仍继续生产、营销和销售含铅汽油。

当然，如今的大型社交媒体公司与 20 世纪中叶的大型烟草公司之间存在巨大差异：社交媒体公司正在生产对成年人有用的产品，帮助他们寻找信息、工作、朋友、爱情和性；使购物和政治组织更加高效；在成千上万的方面让生活变得更轻松。我们大多数人会乐意生活在一个没有烟草的世界里，但社交媒体对许多成年人来说更有价值、更有帮助，甚至更受喜爱。一些成年人存在社交媒体成瘾等问题，但像对待烟草、酒精或赌博一样，我们通常让他们自己做决定。但对于未成年人来说则不是这样。虽然大脑中追求奖赏的部分成熟得较早，但对于自我控制、延迟满足和抵抗诱惑至关重要的额叶皮层直到 20 多岁中期才完全发育成熟，而青春期前的孩子正处于发展的特别脆弱的阶段。当他们开始进入青春期时，他们往往在社交方面缺乏安全感，容易受到同伴压力的影响，也容易被任何看似能给予社交认可的活动所吸引。我们不会让青春期前的孩子购买烟草或酒精，或者进入赌场。与成年人相比，青少年使用社交媒体的成本尤其高，而收益却微乎其微。让孩子们先在地球上成长，而不是过早地将他们“送上火星”。

At t h e t u r n o f t h e m i l l e n n i u m , technologycompaniesbasedonthe
West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products
that took advantage of the rapidly growing internet. There was a widely
shared sense of techno-optimism; these products made life easier, more fun,
and more productive. Some of them helped people to connect and
communicate, and therefore it seemed likely they would be a boon to the
growing number of emerging democracies. Coming soon after the fall of the
Iron Curtain, it felt like the dawn of a new age. The founders of these
companies were hailed as heroes, geniuses, and global benefactors who,
like Prometheus, brought gifts from the gods to humanity.
But the tech industry wasn’t just transforming life for adults. It began
transforming life for children too. Children and adolescents had been
watching a lot of television since the 1950s, but the new technologies were
far more portable, personalized, and engaging than anything that came
before. Parents discovered this truth early, as I did in 2008, when my two￾year-old son mastered the touch-and-swipe interface of my first iPhone.
Many parents were relieved to find that a smartphone or tablet could keep a
child happily engaged and quiet for hours. Was this safe? Nobody knew, but
because everyone else was doing it, everyone just assumed that it must be
okay.
Yet the companies had done little or no research on the mental health
effects of their products on children and adolescents, and they shared no
data with researchers studying the health effects. When faced with growing
evidence that their products were harming young people, they mostly
engaged in denial, obfuscation, and public relations campaigns.[3]
Companies that strive to maximize “engagement” by using psychological
tricks to keep young people clicking were the worst offenders. They hooked
children during vulnerable developmental stages, while their brains were
rapidly rewiring in response to incoming stimulation. This included social
media companies, which inflicted their greatest damage on girls, and video
game companies and pornography sites, which sank their hooks deepest
into boys.[4] By designing a firehose of addictive content that entered
through kids’ eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person
socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human
development on an almost unimaginable scale. The most intense period of
this rewiring was 2010 to 2015, although the story I will tell begins with the
rise of fearful and overprotective parenting in the 1980s and continues
through the COVID pandemic to the present day.
What legal limits have we imposed on these tech companies so far? In
the United States, which ended up setting the norms for most other
countries, the main prohibition is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
Act (COPPA), enacted in 1998. It requires children under 13 to get parental
consent before they can sign a contract with a company (the terms of
service) to give away their data and some of their rights when they open an
account. That set the effective age of “internet adulthood” at 13, for reasons
that had little to do with children’s safety or mental health.[5] But the
wording of the law doesn’t require companies to verify ages; as long as a
child checks a box to assert that she’s old enough (or puts in the right fake
birthday), she can go almost anywhere on the internet without her parents’
knowledge or consent. In fact, 40% of American children under 13 have
created Instagram accounts,[6] yet there has been no update of federal laws
since 1998. (The U.K., on the other hand, has taken some initial steps, as
have a few U.S. states.[7])
A few of these companies are behaving like the tobacco and vaping
industries, which designed their products to be highly addictive and then
skirted laws limiting marketing to minors. We can also compare them to the
oil companies that fought against the banning of leaded gasoline. In the
mid-20th century, evidence began to mount that the hundreds of thousands
of tons of lead put into the atmosphere each year, just by drivers in the
United States, were interfering with the brain development of tens of
millions of children, impairing their cognitive development and increasing
rates of antisocial behavior. Even still, the oil companies continued to
produce, market, and sell it.[8]
Of course, there is an enormous difference between the big social
media companies today and, say, the big tobacco companies of the mid-20th
century: Social media companies are making products that are useful for
adults, helping them to find information, jobs, friends, love, and sex;
making shopping and political organizing more efficient; and making life
easier in a thousand ways. Most of us would be happy to live in a world
with no tobacco, but social media is far more valuable, helpful, and even
beloved by many adults. Some adults have problems with addiction to
social media and other online activities, but as with tobacco, alcohol, or
gambling we generally leave it up to them to make their own decisions.
The same is not true for minors. While the reward-seeking parts of the
brain mature earlier, the frontal cortex—essential for self-control, delay of
gratification, and resistance to temptation—is not up to full capacity until
the mid-20s, and preteens are at a particularly vulnerable point in
development. As they begin puberty, they are often socially insecure, easily
swayed by peer pressure, and easily lured by any activity that seems to offer
social validation. We don’t let preteens buy tobacco or alcohol, or enter
casinos. The costs of using social media, in particular, are high for
adolescents, compared with adults, while the benefits are minimal. Let
children grow up on Earth first, before sending them to Mars.
