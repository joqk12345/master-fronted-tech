# title 从游戏到挑战：一位少年玩家的心理转变 

# chinese 

当听到有关男孩们的故事时，通常都与电子游戏（有时还包括色情内容）而非社交媒体有关，特别是当一个男孩从偶尔玩游戏变成重度玩家的时候。我认识一位木匠，他跟我讲述了关于他14岁的儿子詹姆斯的故事，詹姆斯有轻微的自闭症。在COVID-19疫情爆发前，詹姆斯在学校取得了不错的进步，在柔道这项武术上也是如此。但是一旦学校关闭，当时11岁的詹姆斯，他的父母给他买了一台PlayStation，因为他们需要找些事情让他在家做。

起初，这改善了詹姆斯的生活——他非常喜欢这些游戏以及由此带来的社交联系。但是当他开始长时间玩《堡垒之夜》后，他的行为开始发生变化。“就是那时候出现了抑郁、愤怒和懒惰。那时他开始对我们发脾气。”他的父亲告诉我。为了应对詹姆斯行为上的突然变化，他和他的妻子拿走了他所有的电子产品。当他们这样做时，詹姆斯表现出戒断症状，包括烦躁和攻击性，并且拒绝离开他的房间。尽管几天之后他的症状强度有所减轻，但他的父母仍然感到束手无策：“我们试图限制他的使用时间，但他没有任何朋友，除了他在网上交流的那些，所以我们能怎样限制他呢？”

无论他们的故事模式或严重程度如何，家长们普遍有一种被困住和无力的感觉。大多数家长都不希望自己的孩子有一个以手机为中心的童年，但不知何故，世界已经重新配置，以至于任何抵制的家长似乎都在将他们的孩子推向社交孤立。

在本章的其余部分，我将向您展示证据，证明一些重大的变化正在发生，在2010年代初，年轻人的生活发生了某种变化，导致他们的心理健康状况急剧下降。但在我们深入数据之前，我想与您分享那些感觉他们的孩子在某种程度上被卷走，并且现在正努力将他们拉回来的家长们的声音。

When I hear such stories about boys, they usually involve video games
(and sometimes pornography) rather than social media, particularly when a
boy makes the transition from being a casual gamer to a heavy gamer. I met
a carpenter who told me about his 14-year-old son, James, who has mild
autism. James had been making good progress in school before COVID
arrived, and also in the martial art of judo. But once schools were shut
down, when James was eleven, his parents bought him a PlayStation,
because they had to find something for him to do at home.
At first it improved James’s life—he really enjoyed the games and
social connections. But as he started playing Fortnite for lengthening
periods of time, his behavior began to change. “That’s when all the
depression, anger, and laziness came out. That’s when he started snapping
at us,” the father told me. To address James’s sudden change in behavior, he
and his wife took all of his electronics away. When they did this, James
showed withdrawal symptoms, including irritability and aggressiveness,
and he refused to come out of his room. Although the intensity of his
symptoms lessened after a few days, his parents still felt trapped: “We tried
to limit his use, but he doesn’t have any friends, other than those he
communicates with online, so how much can we cut him off?”
No matter the pattern or severity of their story, what is common among
parents is the feeling that they are trapped and powerless. Most parents
don’t want their children to have a phone-based childhood, but somehow
the world has reconfigured itself so that any parent who resists is
condemning their children to social isolation.
In the rest of this chapter, I’m going to show you evidence that
something big is happening, something changed in the lives of young
people in the early 2010s that made their mental health plunge. But before
we immerse ourselves in the data, I wanted to share with you the voices of
parents who feel that their children were in some sense swept away, and
who are now struggling to get them back.
