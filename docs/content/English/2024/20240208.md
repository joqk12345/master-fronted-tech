# chinese

就像我们召唤了一种外星智能，我们对它了解甚少，除了它极其强大，但也可能会破坏我们文明的基础，我们的社会结构和治理方式都诞生与十九世纪的工业时代，显然还未为这个即将到来的智能时代做好准备，这个架构必须升级，要在 AI 掌握我们之前学会掌握 AI

AI is like an alien intelligence we've summoned - we know little about it, other than that it's incredibly powerful and could potentially shake the foundations of our civilization. Our social structures and governance systems were born out of the industrial age of the nineteenth century and are clearly unprepared for the impending age of intelligence. This framework needs to be upgraded. We need to learn to master AI before it masters us.

This requires proactive engagement from all stakeholders, including governments, private sector, civil society, and academia. It involves creating robust legal, ethical, and regulatory frameworks to guide the development and use of AI. It also requires investing in education and raising public awareness about the potentials and pitfalls of AI. Moreover, we need to foster an interdisciplinary approach that combines technical expertise with insights from social sciences, humanities, and ethics to ensure that AI is developed and used in a way that respects human rights, promotes social good, and mitigates risks.

In addition, there should be more research and development into AI technologies that are transparent, explainable, and controllable, so that we can understand and regulate their behavior. We also need to develop methods for verifying and validating AI systems, and for holding them accountable when things go wrong.

Finally, we should promote international cooperation on AI governance to ensure that all countries can benefit from AI and to prevent a race to the bottom in terms of safety and ethical standards.
