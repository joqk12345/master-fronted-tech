定投践行群之前是龙门资本，龙门资本之前是比特基金。比特基金是2013年成立的。我们的社群是有历史的社群。

在未来的相当长时间，你看到的都是浮盈；只有通过时间的浇筑，只有通过时间的穿透，它才会被固定下来，时间越长，被固定的越多，保持淡定，该干嘛就干嘛。

我们向往的是星辰大海，不是偶尔那点毛毛雨，一切才刚刚开始。你的收益跟你持有的时间成正比关系。

Our investing group, now known as the Regular Investment Practice Group, was once Longmen Capital, and before that, the BitFund, established in 2013. We are a community with a history.

For a good while into the future, what you'll see are paper gains; it's only through the passage of time, through its cementing effect, that these gains solidify. The longer the time, the more that gets locked in. Stay cool and carry on with what you need to do.

We're shooting for the stars, not just a drizzle. This is just the beginning. Your returns are directly proportional to the time you hold.
