虽然能源、粮食、原料的价格容易受到气候、瘟疫和战争的影响周期性波动；还有住房、教育、医疗这些缺乏弹性服务业，而且不容易规模化生产，它们都是长期通胀的驱动力。但技术是通货紧缩的，这不是猜想，这是技术的本质，因为它使得商品和服务的生产能够有效地规模化，当生产能够 100% 满足当前和未来需求的时，长期价格膨胀就变得不可能。

"While prices of energy, food, and raw materials are prone to cyclical fluctuations due to climate, pandemics, and wars, and services like housing, education, and healthcare, which lack elasticity and are hard to produce on a large scale, are long-term drivers of inflation, technology is inherently deflationary. This is not conjecture; it's the nature of technology because it allows for the efficient scaling of goods and services production. When production can 100% meet current and future demand, long-term price inflation becomes impossible."
