# title 并列关系

# chinese 

当你传递感知的时候，你要传递的是一个以上的感知，而不是只有一个感知。就好像我们曾经在课堂上讲过的那样，不仅要有视觉，还要有触觉，甚至有味觉和嗅觉，连心理活动都非常地生动。不要小瞧“and””or”这样的小词，用好它们的意思，不仅说你会用并列这种逻辑关系，更为重要的是，这说明你思考丰富。

When conveying perceptions, it's crucial to communicate more than just one perception. Just like we discussed in class, it's not only about visual input but also about tactile sensations, even including taste and smell, making the psychological experience vivid. Don't underestimate the power of small words like "and" and "or." Mastering their meanings not only shows your ability to use the logical relationship of conjunction but, more importantly, demonstrates your rich thinking process. Trust me, it's a game-changer.
