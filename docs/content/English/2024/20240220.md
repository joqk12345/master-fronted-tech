Your training goal to shape your pronunciation through focused attention is a comprehensive approach. By analyzing seven aspects – pauses, pitch, intonation, stress, rhythm, as well as vowel and consonant variations – you're covering the key elements that contribute to clear and effective speech.
This method is similar to how actors and public speakers train. It's all about control and awareness of your vocal tools. As you practice:

1. **Pauses**: Understand where to take a breath or break in your speech for natural flow and to emphasize points.
2. **Pitch**: Use the rise and fall in the tone of your voice to convey emotions and highlight important information.
3. **Intonation**: The melody of your speech can convey different meanings or emotions even with the same set of words.
4. **Stress**: Emphasize certain words within a sentence to clarify meaning and intent.
5. **Rhythm**: Develop a speech pattern that is engaging and easy for listeners to follow.
6. **Vowels and Consonants**: Work on the clarity and accuracy of each sound to improve overall intelligibility.

Regular practice, possibly with feedback from a coach or through recording and self-review, will help you notice patterns in your speech that you may want to alter. This can be particularly useful if you're trying to reduce a strong regional accent or if you're learning a new language and want to sound more like a native speaker.
