大部分美国影视作品在回忆对 20 世纪 50 年代的记忆时，都会看到年轻人整日整夜地开车兜风、搭讪以获得社会的认可，这是巨大的资源消耗（我们自己的童年可能也是这样，这不过没有车开而已）。现在的孩子们通过在线聊天、网络游戏与朋友们交流玩耍，而不是四处游荡，他们可以通过积累 Instagram、TikTok 还有 Twitter 的关注来获得社会认可。因此，年轻人因为智能手机而抛弃了汽车，这意味着燃烧更少的汽油，使用更少金属资源，最终获得了更多的乐趣。

Most American movies and TV shows depicting memories of the 1950s often show young people cruising around all day and night, flirting to gain social approval. It was a significant drain on resources (our own childhoods might have been similar, just without the cars). Nowadays, kids communicate and play with their friends through online chats and video games instead of roaming around. They can gain social recognition by accumulating followers on Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. As a result, young people have forsaken cars in favor of smartphones, which means burning less gasoline, using fewer metal resources, and ultimately having more fun.
