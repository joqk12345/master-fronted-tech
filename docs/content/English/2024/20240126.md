经济的体量来自于交易，经济的价值则是是关于配置，而不是数量。不是你消耗的资源越多你就越有价值。一堆包含相同数量的硅、钴和砷化镓等原料和这些原料配置而成的手机，显然手机更有价值。将资源从没用的配置重新排列成一个更有用的配置，这就是价值创造。也是我们在资源和能耗基本不变的情况下，让经济保持成长的核心，就是技术改进了配置方法。

"The size of the economy comes from transactions, but the value of the economy is about arrangement, not quantity. It's not about consuming more resources to be more valuable. A pile of raw materials like silicon, cobalt, and gallium arsenide is not as valuable as a phone made from these materials. Shuffling resources from a useless arrangement to a more useful one, that's creating value. That's how we keep the economy growing with basically the same resources and energy consumption - technology improves the way we arrange things."
