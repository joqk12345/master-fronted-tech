# title 新的乐观主义

# chinese 

这段内容继续探讨了人类对未来的渴望和好奇心，以及宗教如何利用这一点来吸引信徒。作者指出，尽管未来尚未到来，人们无法真正感受到它，但人们仍然渴望能够预见未来，尤其是那些能够描述美好未来的人们。这种对未来的好奇心和渴望，使得人们很容易被那些能够系统化描述未来的人所吸引，无论这些描述是否合理。

作者提到，宗教领袖和宗教信仰提供了对未来的系统化描述，这使得它们具有很强的吸引力。宗教通过描述天堂和地狱，为人们提供了一种终极的乐观主义，让人们相信，只要遵循宗教的规则，无论生活中遇到什么困难，最终都会得到美好的结果。

此外，作者还提到了时代的变化。过去，宗教信仰是获得终极乐观主义最常见的途径，但现在情况已经发生了变化。科技进步和社会发展的速度加快，人类平均寿命显著延长，这些变化使得人们能够更直接地感受到生活的变化和改善。

作者强调，过去100年间，科学技术的快速发展带来了巨大的变化，从电力的发明到电子设备的普及，再到交通工具的革新，这些都是人们能够直接感受到的变化。这些变化不仅改变了世界，也改变了人们对未来的看法和期待。

总的来说，这段内容强调了人们对未来的渴望和好奇心，宗教如何利用这一点来吸引信徒，以及时代变化如何影响人们对未来的看法。作者认为，随着科技进步和社会的发展，人们对未来的看法正在发生积极的变化，这为人们提供了一种新的乐观主义。

The passage continues to explore human desires and curiosity about the future, as well as how religions capitalize on this to attract followers. The author points out that despite the inability to truly experience the future, people still long to have glimpses of it, especially when it is described as a promising and positive place. This curiosity and longing for the future make people susceptible to being drawn to those who can systematize and describe it, regardless of the reasonableness of those descriptions. Religious leaders and belief systems, as the author mentions, provide systematic descriptions of the future, which give them strong appeal. By describing heaven and hell, religions offer an ultimate optimism that convinces people that following religious rules will ultimately lead to a positive outcome, no matter the difficulties faced in life.

Furthermore, the author acknowledges the changing times. In the past, religious beliefs were the most common avenue for attaining ultimate optimism, but that has shifted. The rapid advancements in technology and social development, coupled with significantly increased average lifespans, allow people to directly experience changes and improvements in life. The author emphasizes that over the past century, the rapid progress of science and technology has brought about tremendous changes that people can directly feel, from the invention of electricity to the proliferation of electronic devices and the innovation in transportation. These changes have not only transformed the world but also altered people's perspectives and expectations for the future.

In conclusion, this passage underscores human desires and curiosity about the future, how religions capitalize on this to attract followers, and the impact of changing times on people's views of the future. The author suggests that with technological advancements and societal progress, there is a positive shift in people's outlook on the future, providing a new form of optimism.
