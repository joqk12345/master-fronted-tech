# title 拆分工作

# chinese 

本质上所有的教程，所有的教材，所有的道理都可以被拆分成一个又一个的小问题。拆分工作是教练的工作，日常拆分问题，整理答案，不断补充，不断深入呀，这就是教练的日常工作。教练都是这样的，在不断丰富自己的问题库。例如训练学生的观察力，就可以列关于观察的问题清单。

At their core, all tutorials, textbooks, and principles can be broken down into a series of small questions. It's a coach's job to break these down, to dissect problems, compile answers, continually supplementing and delving deeper. That's a coach's daily grind, constantly enriching their question bank. For instance, when training a student's observation skills, they might compile a list of questions related to observation.
