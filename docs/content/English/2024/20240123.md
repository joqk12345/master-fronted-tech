Indeed, with the advancement of technology, more and more industries are reaching this turning point, and the overall market price inflation will become smaller and smaller. Education will see significant cost reductions due to new digital technologies and AI. Healthcare will benefit from advancements in biotech and automation. Even the tough issue of fossil fuels will gradually be replaced and upgraded by the new ecology of renewable energy. It seems that only rare metal resources are finite, but don't forget that SpaceX is leading humanity to the stars, and planetary mining may become mainstream in the future.

Technological deflation, in this sense, is a powerful force that can reshape economies and societies. It can make goods and services more affordable, improve living standards, and potentially solve some of the world's most pressing problems. However, it also brings challenges, such as the potential for job displacement due to automation and the need for individuals and societies to adapt quickly to changes. Nonetheless, the potential benefits of technological deflation are enormous, and it's an exciting time to be alive to witness these transformations.
