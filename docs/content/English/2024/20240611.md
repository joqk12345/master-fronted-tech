# title 人类与其他哺乳动物的区别

# chinese 

人类与其他哺乳动物的区别，特别是人类大脑皮层的发展以及语言文字在知识构建和传承中的作用。以下是对这段内容的总结和提炼：

人类的独特性：人类拥有相对体积最大的大脑皮层，这使得人类能够构建文明。

语言文字的作用：所有知识都是通过语言文字描述和构建的，这使得人类能够传递和传承知识。

知识传承的局限性：其他动物由于没有发展出完整的文字能力，它们的知识和经验无法有效传承，只能依赖基因传递。

语言能力的误解：一些人认为自己掌握的知识和技能无法言传，但这更可能说明的是此人语言能力不足。

文理分科的问题：作者认为文理分科是不合理和愚昧的，因为它导致思维的片面性和不完整性。

学习困难的根源：孩子们在数学等学科上遇到的困难，往往不是来自于学科知识本身，而是语文能力不足，即文字理解能力。

所有学科的核心：如果所有知识都能用语言文字描述和构建，那么归根结底，所有学科的本质都是语文。

语言文字能力的培养：作者提出需要补充一节关于语言文字能力的速成课，并指出语言文字用于描述感知和传递感知。

学习的本质：作者再次强调学习很简单，成绩不好往往折射出的是语文能力的不足。

通过这段内容，作者传达了一个核心观点：语言文字是人类知识构建和传承的基础，对于学习困难的问题，往往应从语文能力的角度来分析和解决。同时，作者也批判了文理分科的现象，认为这种分科方式是不合理的，因为它限制了思维的全面发展。

The focus of learning: For ordinary people, the main task of learning is to understand how to apply knowledge (how), rather than delving deeply into the subject matter (what) or the underlying mechanisms (why).

The three components of knowledge: Any piece of knowledge can be broken down into three parts: the subject, the mechanism, and the usage. Ordinary people should pay more attention to the usage aspect.

Li Xiaolai's works: Li Xiaolai's works, such as "Anyone Can Use English," essentially teach people how to use knowledge.

Learning and application: The essence of learning is to use knowledge, rather than just knowing or understanding it. Many people face obstacles and difficulties when they fail to apply what they have learned.

Example of learning English: Using learning English as an example, the author points out that many people study English for years but never use it, leading to learning failure.

Approach to learning: Learning can be simplified as diligently reading instructions and understanding how to use a tool or knowledge through those instructions.

Human nature: Humans are adept at starting to use something without fully understanding the what and why, and they can use it well.

Difficulty of learning: The difficulty of learning primarily depends on the amount and complexity of the instructions, rather than the inherent difficulty of the knowledge itself.

Attitude towards learning: Learning should be straightforward, with the key being to read, understand, and apply the information in the instructions.

Through this passage, the author conveys a core point: learning is not complicated; it is primarily a process of understanding and applying knowledge. Ordinary people should focus on mastering the application of knowledge rather than delving into its discovery and scientific principles. Additionally, the author emphasizes the connection between learning and practical application, as well as the importance of having the right attitude during the learning process.
