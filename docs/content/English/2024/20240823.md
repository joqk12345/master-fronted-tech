《关于“现实世界”与“虚拟世界”术语的几点说明》

关于术语有几点说明。当我谈到“现实世界”时，我指的是具有以下四个数百万年来一直典型的特征的关系和社会互动：
1. 它们是具身性的，这意味着我们用身体进行交流，我们能意识到他人的身体存在，并且我们会有意无意地对他人的身体作出反应。
2. 它们是同步发生的，这意味着它们同时进行，包含有关时机和轮流的微妙线索。
3. 它们主要涉及一对一或一对少数的交流，在给定的时刻只有一个互动在发生。
4. 它们发生在具有较高进入和退出门槛的社区内，所以当关系出现裂痕时，人们有强烈的动力去投入修复关系。

相反，当我谈到“虚拟世界”时，我指的是具有以下四个仅仅几十年才典型的特征的关系和互动：
1. 它们是非具身性的，这意味着不需要身体，只需要语言。交流对象可能是（而且已经有）人工智能。
2. 它们是高度异步的，通过基于文本的帖子和评论发生。（视频通话则不同，它是同步的。）
3. 它们涉及大量的一对多交流，向潜在的庞大受众进行广播。多个互动可以同时并行发生。
4. 它们发生在具有较低进入和退出门槛的社区内，所以当人们不高兴时可以屏蔽他人或直接退出。社区往往是短暂的，关系也常常是一次性的。

实际上，界限是模糊的。我的家庭很大程度上属于现实世界，尽管我们也使用 FaceTime、短信和电子邮件来保持联系。相反，18 世纪两个仅通过信件交流而彼此认识的科学家之间的关系更接近于一种虚拟关系。关键因素是维持关系所需的投入。当人们在一个他们无法轻易逃离的社区中成长时，他们会做我们的祖先数百万年来一直在做的事情：他们学习如何处理关系，以及如何管理自己和自己的情绪，以维持那些珍贵的关系。当然，有许多在线社区已经找到了建立牢固的人际承诺和归属感的方法，但总的来说，当孩子们在多个不断变化的网络中成长，在那里他们不需要使用真实姓名，只需点击一下按钮就可以退出，他们就不太可能学会这些技能。

A f e w n o t e s a b o u t t e r m i n o l o g y . Wh e n I talkaboutthe“r e a l
world,” I am referring to relationships and social interactions characterized
by four features that have been typical for millions of years:
1. They are embodied, meaning that we use our bodies to communicate,
we are conscious of the bodies of others, and we respond to the
bodies of others both consciously and unconsciously.
2. They are synchronous, which means they are happening at the same
time, with subtle cues about timing and turn taking.
3. They involve primarily one-to-one or one-to-several communication,
with only one interaction happening at a given moment.
4. They take place within communities that have a high bar for entry
and exit, so people are strongly motivated to invest in relationships
and repair rifts when they happen.
In contrast, when I talk about the “virtual world,” I am referring to
relationships and interactions characterized by four features that have been
typical for just a few decades:
1. They are disembodied, meaning that no body is needed, just
language. Partners could be (and already are) artificial intelligences
(AIs).
2. They are heavily asynchronous, happening via text-based posts and
comments. (A video call is different; it is synchronous.)
3. They involve a substantial number of one-to-many communications,
broadcasting to a potentially vast audience. Multiple interactions can
be happening in parallel.
4. They take place within communities that have a low bar for entry and
exit, so people can block others or just quit when they are not
pleased. Communities tend to be short-lived, and relationships are
often disposable.
In practice, the lines blur. My family is very much real world, even
though we use FaceTime, texting, and email to keep in touch. Conversely, a
relationship between two scientists in the 18th century who knew each other
only from an exchange of letters was closer to a virtual relationship. The
key factor is the commitment required to make relationships work. When
people are raised in a community that they cannot easily escape, they do
what our ancestors have done for millions of years: They learn how to
manage relationships, and how to manage themselves and their emotions in
order to keep those precious relationships going. There are certainly many
online communities that have found ways to create strong interpersonal
commitments and a feeling of belonging, but in general, when children are
raised in multiple mutating networks where they don’t need to use their real
names and they can quit with the click of a button, they are less likely to
learn such skills.
