# title: 人类被人或者AI操控

# chinese
人类通常无法直接接触到现实，我们被文化所包围，透过文化棱镜体验现实。几千年来，人类一直生活在别人的梦中。我们崇拜神明，追求美的理想，并将我们的生命献给一些先知、政治家想象出的事业。很快，我们也将发现自己生活在非人类智能的幻觉中

# english
Humans usually cannot directly touch reality; we are surrounded by culture and experience reality through the prism of culture. For thousands of years, humans have been living in the dreams of others. We worship gods, pursue ideals of beauty, and dedicate our lives to causes imagined by prophets and politicians. Soon, we may find ourselves living in the illusions created by non-human intelligence.
