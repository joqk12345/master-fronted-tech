生产的形式抽象来看归结起来有三种:发现、制作、交易。 当今社会，电商平台都变成了贸易商。
现在的打工人最划算的方式就是销售做起，销售是制作与需求之间的中间环节，它的好处有距离制作足够的近，理解真正的需求，理解真正的竞争，收入可以无上限，学历与专业无要求，没有破产压力。销售本身就是知识，很重要很关键的知识。

In abstract terms, production can be categorized into three forms: discovery, manufacturing, and trade. In today's society, e-commerce platforms have become the new traders.
For individuals seeking the most advantageous employment, sales is the way to go. Sales acts as the intermediary between production and demand. Its benefits lie in its proximity to the manufacturing process, understanding genuine needs and competition. Sales offers unlimited income potential, without the requirement of a specific degree or expertise, and alleviates the pressure of bankruptcy. Sales itself is knowledge, a crucial and significant skill.
