# title 文采的作用

# chinese 
这个文采也好，修辞也罢，他们不是为了显摆自己才华的，而是为了更好的传递感知，正如你用兵器是为了打赢而不是显摆，正如你玩乐器是为了欢乐，也不是为了显摆，至于显摆，永远不配当做目的。

# english
Whether it's about the style or the rhetoric, it's not about showing off. It's about conveying perception, just like you wield a weapon to win, not to show off, or play an instrument for joy, not for show. Showboating should never be the end goal.
