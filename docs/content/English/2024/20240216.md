"Different motivations lead to different levels of drive, resulting in vastly different outcomes. Here are the motivations for a teacher in 2024, guiding everyone to learn a foreign language:

A chance to revamp language skills.
An opportunity to alter a family's fate.
Regular investments to change destiny, revealing truths about thought and learning.
Training a bunch of 'Learning Dads', easily surpassing most middle-school English teachers in China.
Changing the learning attitudes of many more.
Learning for the sake of the kids.
Striving to create a better home environment."
These motivations reflect the educator's understanding of the profound impact of learning a foreign language. It's not just about the language itself, but the comprehensive positive changes that come with it.
