# title 真正的专家

# chinese 
真正的专家虽然会错误的告诉你创作这事儿是有门槛的，但他们不是故意骗你，而是他们误会了，所以他们会同样真诚的告诉你：天赋并不重要。

While true experts may mistakenly tell you that there's a threshold for creative writing, they're not intentionally deceiving you. It's just a misunderstanding on their part. However, they will sincerely tell you that talent isn't crucial.
