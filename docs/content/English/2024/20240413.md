# title 简单与复杂

# chinese 

- 这个好消息是天下所有复杂的系统，其实都是由简单的部件构成的。所以呢，天下没有简单的东西。但与此同时，天下又只有简单的东西。因为什么东西看起来挺复杂的，但事实上啊，又都是很简单的。这不是人们以为的矛盾啊，而是一个事实啊，矛与盾要组合起来才是有效的战斗工具。

Here's the good news: all complex systems in the world are made up of simple parts. So, there's no such thing as simplicity, yet everything is simple. What seems complex is actually quite straightforward. This isn't a contradiction as one might think, but a fact, just like a spear and shield become an effective combat tool only when combined.
