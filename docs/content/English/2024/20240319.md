# title 三种递进的逻辑关系

# chinese 
有三种递进的逻辑关系分别是——从简单到复杂，从次要到重要，从已知到未知。最具价值的是其中的第三种，叫：从已知到未知。因为在此之前他们不知道，因为在此之前他们没想到。他们不仅感受到价值、感受到收获，甚至会感受到惊喜。这也是为什么哈，像我们这种严肃的创作者绝不抄袭的核心理由。因为那不符合我们的价值观，更直白的表述是，因为那样的话就无法体现我们自身价值。

There are three types of progressive logical relationships: from simple to complex, from minor to major, and from known to unknown. The most valuable among them is the third one, known as "from known to unknown." Before this progression, they were unaware, as they hadn't considered it before. They not only experience value and gain, but they may even feel surprised. That's why serious creators like us never resort to plagiarism—it goes against our values. To put it bluntly, it doesn't reflect our own worth.
