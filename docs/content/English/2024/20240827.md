《找回人类生活的本真：从古人智慧中汲取力量》

在撰写《幸福的假设》时，我开始对古代智慧和前人的发现怀有深深的敬意。关于如何管理我们以手机为基础的生活，今天的圣贤会给我们什么建议呢？他们会告诉我们放下设备，重新掌控我们的思想。

公元一世纪的爱比克泰德曾哀叹人类让他人控制自己情绪的倾向：

如果你的身体被随意交给任何人，你无疑会表示反对。那你为什么不感到羞愧呢？因为你让你的思想容易受到任何碰巧批评你的人的影响，以至于它会自动变得困惑和不安。

任何查看社交媒体上“提及”自己的内容的人，或者曾经因为某人发布的关于自己的内容而陷入混乱的人，都会理解爱比克泰德的担忧。即使是那些很少被提及或批评的人，那些只是浏览着无穷无尽的包含他人行为、咆哮和动态的信息流的人，也会欣赏公元二世纪马可·奥勒留给自己的建议：

不要把你在这里剩下的时间浪费在担心别人上——除非这影响到公共利益。它会阻止你做任何有用的事情。你会过于专注于某某人在做什么、为什么做、他们在说什么、他们在想什么、他们在忙什么，以及所有其他让你分心、使你无法专注于自己思想的事情。

X 世代及之前世代的成年人自 2010 年以来并没有经历临床抑郁症或焦虑症的大幅增加，但我们中的许多人却因为新技术及其不断的干扰和分心而变得更加疲惫、心烦意乱和精疲力竭。随着生成式人工智能能够制作超逼真的伪造照片、视频和新闻故事，网络生活可能会变得更加令人困惑。但情况不必如此；我们可以重新掌控自己的思想。

这本书不仅适合父母、教师和其他关心或照顾孩子的人。它也适合任何想要了解人类历史上人际关系和意识最迅速的重构是如何使我们所有人更难思考、集中注意力、忘我地关心他人以及建立亲密关系的人。

《焦虑的一代》是一本关于如何为各代人找回人类生活的书。

respect for ancient wisdom and the discoveries of previous generations.
What would the sages advise us today about managing our phone-based
lives? They’d tell us to get off our devices and regain control of our minds.
Here is Epictetus, in the first century CE, lamenting the human tendency to
let others control our emotions:
If your body was turned over to just anyone, you would doubtless
take exception. Why aren’t you ashamed that you have made your
mind vulnerable to anyone who happens to criticize you, so that it
automatically becomes confused and upset?[19]
Anyone who checks their “mentions” on social media, or has ever been
thrown for a loop by what somebody posted about them, will understand
Epictetus’s concern. Even those who are rarely mentioned or criticized, and
who simply scroll through a bottomless feed featuring the doings, rantings,
and goings-on of other people, will appreciate Marcus Aurelius’s advice to
himself, in the second century CE:
Don’t waste the rest of your time here worrying about other people
—unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing
anything useful. You’ll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so is
doing, and why, and what they’re saying, and what they’re
thinking, and what they’re up to, and all the other things that throw
you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind.[20]
Adults in Gen X and prior generations have not experienced much of a
rise in clinical depression or anxiety disorders since 2010,[21] but many of
us have become more frazzled, scattered, and exhausted by our new
technologies and their incessant interruptions and distractions. As
generative AI enables the production of super-realistic and fabricated
photographs, videos, and news stories, life online is likely to get far more
confusing.[22] It doesn’t have to be that way; we can regain control of our
own minds.
This book is not just for parents, teachers, and others who care for or
about children. It is for anyone who wants to understand how the most rapid
rewiring of human relationships and consciousness in human history has
made it harder for all of us to think, focus, forget ourselves enough to care
about others, and build close relationships.
The Anxious Generation is a book about how to reclaim human life for
human beings in all generations.
