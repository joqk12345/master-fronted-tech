《保护儿童：现实与虚拟世界的权衡与改革建议》

我们在让现实世界对儿童安全方面有一个多世纪的经验。汽车在 20 世纪初开始流行，数以万计的儿童死于车祸，直到我们最终强制要求使用安全带（20 世纪 60 年代），然后是儿童安全座椅（20 世纪 80 年代）。在 20 世纪 70 年代末我上高中的时候，我的许多同学都抽烟，他们可以很容易地从自动售货机买到香烟。最终，美国禁止了这些自动售货机，这给成年吸烟者带来了不便，他们随后不得不从可以核实他们年龄的店员那里购买香烟。

在几十年的时间里，我们找到了保护儿童同时又基本允许成年人做他们想做的事情的方法。然后突然之间，我们创造了一个虚拟世界，在这个世界里，成年人可以放纵任何一时的冲动，但儿童却几乎毫无防备。随着越来越多的证据表明以手机为基础的童年正在使我们的孩子心理不健康、社交孤立和深感不快乐，我们能接受这种权衡吗？或者我们最终会像在 20 世纪所做的那样意识到，有时我们需要保护儿童免受伤害，即使这会给成年人带来不便？

我将在第四部分提出许多改革建议，所有这些建议都旨在纠正我们所犯的两个大错误：在现实世界中过度保护儿童（而他们需要从大量的直接经验中学习）以及在网络上保护不足（他们在青春期时在网络上尤其脆弱）。我提出的建议基于我在第一至第三部分所呈现的研究。由于研究结果很复杂，而且其中一些在研究人员中存在争议，所以我肯定在某些方面会出错，我将尽我所能通过更新本书的在线补充内容来纠正任何错误。尽管如此，有四项改革非常重要，我对此有高度的信心，因此我将它们称为基础改革。它们将为数字时代更健康的童年奠定基础。它们是：

1. 高中之前不使用智能手机。家长应该推迟孩子全天接入互联网的时间，在九年级（大约 14 岁）之前只给他们配备基本手机（应用程序有限且没有网络浏览器的手机）。
2. 16 岁之前不使用社交媒体。让孩子们度过大脑发育最脆弱的时期，然后再让他们接触大量的社会比较和算法选择的网红信息。
3. 学校禁止使用手机。在从小学到高中的所有学校里，学生应该在上学期间把他们的手机、智能手表以及任何其他可以发送或接收短信的个人设备存放在手机储物柜或带锁的袋子里。这是让他们把注意力从手机转移到彼此和老师身上的唯一方法。
4. 增加更多无人监管的玩耍和儿童的独立性。这是孩子们自然发展社交技能、克服焦虑并成为自我管理的年轻人的方式。

这四项改革并不难实施——如果我们很多人同时去做的话。它们几乎不需要花费任何成本。即使我们从未得到立法者的帮助，它们也会起作用。如果一个社区的大多数家长和学校都实施这四项改革，我相信他们会在两年内看到青少年心理健康状况有显著改善。考虑到人工智能和空间计算（比如苹果新推出的 Vision Pro 眼镜）即将使虚拟世界变得更加身临其境和容易让人上瘾，我认为我们最好从今天就开始行动。

world safe for kids. Automobiles became popular in the early 20th century
and tens of thousands of children died in them until eventually we
mandated seat belts (in the 1960s) and then car seats (in the 1980s).[17]
When I was in high school in the late 1970s, many of my fellow students
smoked cigarettes, which they could easily buy from vending machines.
Eventually, America banned those machines, inconveniencing adult
smokers, who then had to purchase cigarettes from a store clerk who could
verify their age.[18]
Over the course of many decades, we found ways to protect children
while mostly allowing adults to do what they want. Then quite suddenly, we
created a virtual world where adults could indulge any momentary whim,
but children were left nearly defenseless. As evidence mounts that phone￾based childhood is making our children mentally unhealthy, socially
isolated, and deeply unhappy, are we okay with that trade-off? Or will we
eventually realize, as we did in the 20th century, that we sometimes need to
protect children from harm even when it inconveniences adults?
I’ll offer many ideas for reforms in part 4, all of which aim to reverse
the two big mistakes we’ve made: overprotecting children in the real world
(where they need to learn from vast amounts of direct experience) and
underprotecting them online (where they are particularly vulnerable during
puberty). The suggestions I offer are based on the research I present in parts
1 through 3. Since the research findings are complicated and some of them
are contested among researchers, I will surely be wrong on some points,
and I will do my best to correct any errors by updating the online
supplement for the book. Nonetheless, there are four reforms that are so
important, and in which I have such a high degree of confidence, that I’m
going to call them foundational. They would provide a foundation for
healthier childhood in the digital age. They are:
1. No smartphones before high school. Parents should delay children’s
entry into round-the-clock internet access by giving only basic
phones (phones with limited apps and no internet browser) before
ninth grade (roughly age 14).
2. No social media before 16. Let kids get through the most vulnerable
period of brain development before connecting them to a firehose of
social comparison and algorithmically chosen influencers.
3. Phone-free schools. In all schools from elementary through high
school, students should store their phones, smartwatches, and any
other personal devices that can send or receive texts in phone lockers
or locked pouches during the school day. That is the only way to free
up their attention for each other and for their teachers.
4. Far more unsupervised play and childhood independence. That’s the
way children naturally develop social skills, overcome anxiety, and
become self-governing young adults.
These four reforms are not hard to implement—if many of us do them
at the same time. They cost almost nothing. They will work even if we
never get help from our legislators. If most of the parents and schools in a
community were to enact all four, I believe they would see substantial
improvements in adolescent mental health within two years. Given that AI
and spatial computing (such as Apple’s new Vision Pro goggles) are about
to make the virtual world far more immersive and addictive, I think we’d
better start today.
