# title 夫妻关系质量影响子女的成长与未来

# chinese 
夫妻关系的质量会深深影响子女的成长和未来。如果夫妻关系不和，这种负面的模式可能会像遗传一样，被子女复制并带入他们的人际关系和家庭生活中。这种影响可能会导致子女在与他人交往方面存在困难，无法建立和维护长期的信任关系。

作者分享了他自己的经历，他成长在一个夫妻关系不和的家庭中，但他决心不要活成父母那样，因此他和他的妻子在过去的20多年里从未吵架。然而，他的弟弟却复刻了父母的模式，最终离婚。这个例子说明，虽然有些人能够从负面的家庭环境中走出来并改变，但大多数人可能会复制他们父母的模式。

这段话也强调了，家庭是社会的最小组织单位，一个人的与人交往的能力是非常重要的。没有这个能力，人的生活和工作都可能会受到影响。因此，我们应该更加重视和珍视我们的夫妻关系，因为这不仅关系到我们自身的幸福，也关系到我们的子女的未来。

The quality of the marital relationship deeply impacts the growth and future of children. If the marital relationship is strained, this negative pattern can be replicated by children, much like inheriting a genetic trait, and affect their interpersonal relationships and family life. This influence can lead to difficulties in interacting with others and an inability to establish and maintain long-term trust relationships.

The author shares their own experience of growing up in a discordant marital relationship but making a conscious decision not to repeat their parents' patterns. As a result, they and their spouse have never argued in over 20 years. However, their sibling replicated their parents' pattern and ended up getting divorced. This example illustrates that while some individuals can break free from negative family environments and make changes, the majority may end up replicating their parents' patterns.

This passage also emphasizes that the family is the smallest unit of society, and one's ability to interact with others is crucial. Without this ability, both personal life and work can be affected. Therefore, we should value and cherish our marital relationship even more because it not only affects our own happiness but also influences the future of our children.
