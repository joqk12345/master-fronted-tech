# title 一个人最好的修行

# chinese 

当一个人尝尽了社会的无情，人心的险恶，经济的压力，婚姻的不堪，你终会领悟到，放下执念，善待自己，唯有读书和赚钱，才是一个人最好的修行，前者使人不惑，后者使人不屈。-稻盛和夫

Inoue Kazuo once said, "After tasting society's harshness, human treachery, economic pressure, and marital strife, you'll realize: let go of obsessions, be kind to yourself. Reading and earning money are the best practices—one clears doubts, the other keeps you unbowed."
