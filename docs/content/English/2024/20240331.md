# title 输出的目的和目标

# chinese 

创作的目的为了沟通。所谓的有效沟通就是让对方自己 明白自己之前不明白的道理，了解他自己之前不知道的事实。 修辞让受众获得在此之前并未获得的感知，只有这样的修辞才是有效修辞。所以定义自己为沟通者，千百年前的孙子教导过很多人，”知己知彼，百战不殆“。

# english
The purpose of creation is communication. Effective communication is when you enlighten someone on truths they didn't grasp before, or inform them about facts they were unaware of. Rhetoric should provide the audience with insights they haven't experienced before - that's what makes it effective. So, consider yourself a communicator. As Sun Tzu taught centuries ago, "Know thyself, know thy enemy, and you shall win a hundred battles."
