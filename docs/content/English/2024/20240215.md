# chinese : 
vim 就是一个工具，你需要像学习新语言一样学习他，他分享了他学习英语的经历，他不是一个天生讲英语的人，在13岁的时候来到了美国，他学英语的方法就是 1. 学习语法规则，2. 增加词汇量，3. 练习、练习，直到你不用思考就能跟他对话。

"Vim is a tool, and you need to learn it like you're learning a new language. The speaker shared his experience learning English. He wasn't a natural English speaker and moved to the United States when he was 13. His method for learning English was: 1. Learning grammar rules, 2. Expanding vocabulary, and 3. Practicing over and over until he could converse without having to think about it."
