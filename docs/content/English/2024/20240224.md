# title 新的知识分类 

# chinese 
有一种新的知识分类叫做必须集中密集训练的知识。我最近在密集训练英语的口语以及linux开发中的VIM工具，几乎同时开始的，在练习了将近一个半月之后有了实质的进步。耳朵变的灵敏了起来。使用vim的手也开始快了起来。这来自每天3小时的注意力投入和时间投入，以及在训练过程中对所有细节的记忆和应用，如果在叠加像老师备课一样的认知准备，经过1000小时的训练这个知识就会内化于心达到日用而不知的境界了。

There's this thing called knowledge that needs intense focus and practice. I've been hitting the grindstone hard with my English speaking and using the VIM tool in Linux development. I started both around the same time and after a month and a half, I'm seeing real progress. My ears are getting sharper and my fingers are flying on VIM.

This comes from pouring in three hours daily, paying attention, remembering every detail, and applying it. If you stack on the kind of prep teachers do for class, and clock in a thousand hours, this knowledge becomes second nature – you use it without even thinking.
