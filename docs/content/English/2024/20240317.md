# title 如何验证思考丰富

# chinese 
当你在传递感知的时候，你能传递多个感官的感知，当你举例的时候，你能举出很多例子，而不是For example就只有1个example。当你陈述一个结论的时候，能够给出很多的理由；当你讲述一个故事的时候，能描述很多的细节。你不要误以为谁都可以做到，大多数人不会传递感知；大多数人被要求举例的时候会哑口无言；大多数人硬着头皮讲故事的时候，对描述细节无能为力。为什么啊？因为思考不丰富，因为思考不够丰富。

When you're conveying perceptions, you can indeed convey sensory experiences from multiple senses. When providing examples, you can offer numerous instances instead of just one when using "For example." When presenting a conclusion, you can provide multiple reasons to support it. When telling a story, you can describe a plethora of details. Don't assume that everyone can do this because most people struggle to convey perceptions. Many individuals find themselves at a loss when asked for examples, and when it comes to storytelling, they lack the ability to describe details. Why is that? It's because their thinking isn't rich enough, simply put, their thinking lacks depth.
