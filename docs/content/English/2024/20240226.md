# title 单词找不到家

# chinese 
最近在读各种英语读物也会下意识的查查不懂的英语单词并且把他们整理成一个词表，但是过几天过重新去复习这些词表的时就会找不到这些单词在哪出现过就忘记了为什么会记住这个单词，我就调侃到单次找不到句子或者context就像孩子找不到家一样，下次记录词表一定要引用一下单词的出处，或者专门为内容整理自己的词表。

I've been reading a lot of English stuff recently and I've been looking up words I don't know, making a word list. But when I review the list a few days later, I can't remember where I saw these words or why I even noted them down. It's like a kid who can't find their way home without context. Next time I make a word list, I'm definitely going to note down where I saw the word, or maybe even create a dedicated word list for each piece of content.
