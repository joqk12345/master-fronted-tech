重庆除了有一个超级大的超级飞侠主题酒店以外，重庆洪崖洞民宿风貌区应该是重庆最著名的景点，它以重庆传统民俗风貌为主，有吊脚楼、洪雅滴翠、山城老街等经典，夜晚的洪崖洞灯火通明、美轮美奂。

Aside from hosting a massive Super Wings themed hotel, Chongqing is probably best known for its Hongya Cave folk custom area. It's characterized by traditional Chongqing folk customs, featuring stilt houses, Hongya Dicui, and the old streets of the mountain city. At night, the lights of Hongya Cave are brilliant and beautiful.
