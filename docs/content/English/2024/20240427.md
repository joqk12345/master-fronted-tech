# chinese 如何修复情绪

- 我现在有这个情绪我是站在现在的、还是因为我站在过去的还是我站在未来呢？
	- 如果你站在过去，你会发现负面情绪很严重
	- 如果你站在现在，你会发现你会极其亢奋
	- 如果你站在未来呢？你会觉得现在这些情绪意义不大，甚至没有意义，如果有意义也一定是负面意义，你就没脾气了，没情绪

Are my feelings rooted in the present, or are they echoes from the past, or perhaps worries for the future?

If you're stuck in the past, you might find yourself swamped with negative vibes. Living in the moment could leave you super pumped. But what if you're focused on the future? You might see these current emotions as trivial, even pointless. If they hold any weight, it's likely negative, leaving you without the fire or passion.
