# title 《童年的转变：从玩耍到手机》

# chinese 


大重构不仅仅关乎塑造孩子们日常生活和思维的技术变革。这里还有第二条故事线：出于善意但却带来灾难性后果的对儿童过度保护以及限制他们在现实世界中自主性的转变。孩子们需要大量的自由玩耍才能茁壮成长。这一必要性在所有哺乳动物物种中都显而易见。玩耍过程中出现的小规模挑战和挫折就像一种预防接种，让孩子们为日后面对更大的挑战做好准备。但由于各种历史和社会学原因，自由玩耍在 20 世纪 80 年代开始减少，到 90 年代这种减少趋势加快。在美国、英国和加拿大，大人们越来越认为，如果他们让孩子在无人监管的情况下到户外去，孩子就会吸引来绑架者和性侵犯者。在无人监管的户外玩耍减少的同时，个人电脑变得越来越普遍，作为一个消磨空闲时间的地方也变得更具吸引力。

我认为我们可以把 20 世纪 80 年代末看作是从“以玩耍为基础的童年”向“以手机为基础的童年”转变的开始，这种转变直到 21 世纪 10 年代中期大多数青少年拥有自己的智能手机时才完成。我这里所说的“以手机为基础”含义很宽泛，包括所有接入互联网的个人电子设备，这些设备开始占据年轻人的时间，包括笔记本电脑、平板电脑、联网的电子游戏机，最重要的是拥有数百万应用程序的智能手机。

当我谈到“以玩耍为基础”或“以手机为基础”的“童年”时，我也是在宽泛地使用这个术语。我是指它同时包括儿童和青少年（而不必写成“以手机为基础的童年和青春期”）。发展心理学家通常把童年和青春期的过渡标记为青春期的开始，但由于不同孩子进入青春期的时间不同，而且近几十年来青春期的开始时间一直在提前，所以再把青春期等同于青少年时期就不正确了。本书的其余部分将按以下方式对年龄进行分类：

儿童：0 至 12 岁。
青少年：10 至 20 岁。
青少年（十几岁时期）：13 至 19 岁。
未成年人：所有 18 岁以下的人。我有时也会使用“孩子”这个词，因为它听起来不像“未成年人”那么正式和专业。

儿童和青少年的年龄有重叠是有意为之的：10 至 12 岁的孩子正处于童年和青春期之间，因此通常被称为“少年前期儿童”。（这一时期也被称为青春早期。）他们像更小的孩子一样爱玩，但也开始发展出青少年的社会和心理复杂性。

随着从以玩耍为基础的童年向以手机为基础的童年的转变，许多儿童和青少年非常乐意待在室内上网玩耍，但在这个过程中，他们失去了接触那些所有年轻哺乳动物都需要的具有挑战性的身体和社会体验的机会，而这些体验对于发展基本能力、克服天生的童年恐惧以及为减少对父母的依赖做准备都是必需的。与同龄人进行的虚拟互动并不能完全弥补这些体验的缺失。此外，那些把玩耍时间和社交生活转移到网上的孩子发现自己越来越多地在成人空间里游荡，消费成人内容，并以往往对未成年人有害的方式与成人互动。因此，即使父母努力消除现实世界中的风险和自由，他们通常（而且往往是在不知不觉中）却在虚拟世界中给予了孩子完全的独立，部分原因是大多数父母发现很难理解虚拟世界中正在发生的事情，更不用说知道该限制什么或者如何进行限制了。

我在本书中的核心观点是，这两种趋势——现实世界中的过度保护和虚拟世界中的保护不足——是 1995 年以后出生的孩子成为焦虑一代的主要原因。

that shape children’s days and minds. There’s a second plotline here: the
well-intentioned and disastrous shift toward overprotecting children and
restricting their autonomy in the real world. Children need a great deal of
free play to thrive. It’s an imperative that’s evident across all mammal
species. The small-scale challenges and setbacks that happen during play
are like an inoculation that prepares children to face much larger challenges
later. But for a variety of historical and sociological reasons, free play
began to decline in the 1980s, and the decline accelerated in the 1990s.
Adults in the United States, the U.K., and Canada increasingly began to
assume that if they ever let a child walk outside unsupervised, the child
would attract kidnappers and sex offenders. Unsupervised outdoor play
declined at the same time that the personal computer became more common
and more inviting as a place for spending free time.[*]
I propose that we view the late 1980s as the beginning of the transition
from a “play-based childhood” to a “phone-based childhood,” a transition
that was not complete until the mid-2010s, when most adolescents had their
own smartphone. I use “phone-based” broadly to include all of the internet￾connected personal electronics that came to fill young people’s time,
including laptop computers, tablets, internet-connected video game
consoles, and, most important, smartphones with millions of apps.
When I speak of a play-based or phone-based “childhood,” I’m using
that term broadly too. I mean it to include both children and adolescents
(rather than having to write out “phone-based childhood and adolescence”).
Developmental psychologists often mark the transition between childhood
and adolescence as being the onset of puberty, but because puberty arrives
at different times for different kids, and because it has been shifting
younger in recent decades, it is no longer correct to equate adolescence to
the teen years.[13] This is how age will be categorized in the rest of this
book:
Children: 0 through 12.
Adolescents: 10 through 20.
Teens: 13 through 19.
Minors: Everyone who is under 18. I’ll also use the word “kids”
sometimes, because it sounds less formal and technical than “minors.”
The overlap between children and adolescents is intentional: Kids who
are 10 to 12 are between childhood and adolescence, and are often called
tweens for that reason. (This period is also known as early adolescence.)
They are as playful as younger children, yet they are beginning to develop
the social and psychological complexities of adolescents.
As the transition from play-based to phone-based childhood proceeded,
many children and adolescents were perfectly happy to stay indoors and
play online, but in the process they lost exposure to the kinds of challenging
physical and social experiences that all young mammals need to develop
basic competencies, overcome innate childhood fears, and prepare to rely
less on their parents. Virtual interactions with peers do not fully compensate
for these experiential losses. Moreover, those whose playtime and social
lives moved online found themselves increasingly wandering through adult
spaces, consuming adult content, and interacting with adults in ways that
are often harmful to minors. So even while parents worked to eliminate risk
and freedom in the real world, they generally, and often unknowingly,
granted full independence in the virtual world, in part because most found it
difficult to understand what was going on there, let alone know what to
restrict or how to restrict it.
My central claim in this book is that these two trends—overprotection
in the real world and underprotection in the virtual world—are the major
reasons why children born after 1995 became the anxious generation.
