随着能源、智能和灵活性的成本趋近于零，整个经济将变得更大，结构上更加盈利。科技公司将有巨大的机会向他们销售即插即用的劳动力和智能，本质上是将现在分散且不一致的人类劳动力产品化、集中化、按需化和作为服务软件化 (SaaS 化)

Indeed, as the costs of energy, intelligence, and flexibility continue to decrease, we can expect significant transformations in the economy. The economy may become larger and structurally more profitable, which presents enormous opportunities for technology companies.

One of the most significant opportunities lies in the realm of labor and intelligence as a service. Technology companies can essentially productize, centralize, on-demand, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) human labor that is currently dispersed and inconsistent. This can be seen in developments like AI and automation technologies, which are increasingly being used to perform tasks traditionally done by human workers. 

For instance, many companies are now offering AI-powered services that can automate tasks like customer service, content creation, data analysis, and more. These services are often provided on a subscription basis, similar to SaaS models. By doing so, they effectively turn human labor into a scalable, on-demand service that can be accessed and utilized by businesses around the world.

Moreover, this trend is likely to accelerate as AI and automation technologies continue to improve and become more affordable. This could lead to a future where many forms of human labor are delivered as digital services, which could significantly alter the structure of the economy and the nature of work.

However, it's also important to consider the potential implications of this shift, including the impact on jobs and income inequality. Policymakers, businesses, and society at large will need to navigate these challenges as we move towards this new economic paradigm.
