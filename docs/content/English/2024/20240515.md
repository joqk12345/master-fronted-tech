# chinese 

作者在这段话中进一步强调了除了金钱之外，时间也是在家庭中非常重要的投入。他认为，投入的时间决定了关系的质量，而且越多的投入，对方就会越珍惜那些原本可以用来投资未来的时间。

他也谈到了自己对朋友的定义的演化过程。最初，朋友只是那些与我们共度时间，让我们感觉温暖的人。后来，他重新定义了朋友，是那些与我们共度时间，让我们感觉温暖，让我们心甘情愿地付出的人。然后，他的定义又进化了，朋友是那些他愿意花时间和精力与之共同做成至少一件事的人。

作者还引用了古代混江湖的人常说的一句话：“兄弟如手足，妻子如衣服。”他解释说，这句话后面的部分是：“衣服破尚可缝，手足断安可续。”这实际上是在强调，如果失去了妻子，还可以找回来，但如果失去了兄弟，就无法再找回来。

在谈到家庭建设的过程中，作者强调了共同成长的重要性。他认为，无论是他还是他的妻子，都需要长期持续进步，然后终生发展。他们一起做的事情有很多，比如家庭建设、学习、娱乐等。他们的下一步计划是要多生孩子。

总的来说，作者在这段话中强调了在家庭中投入的时间和共同成长的重要性，以及他对朋友定义的演化过程。他认为，这些都是家庭建设和维持亲密关系的关键因素。

The author further emphasizes that, besides money, time is a crucial investment in a family. They believe that the time invested determines the quality of the relationship, and the more time given, the more the other party will value the time that could have been invested in the future.

They also discuss the evolution of their definition of a friend. Initially, friends were merely those who spent time with us, making us feel warm. Later, they redefined friends as those with whom we willingly spend time, who make us feel warm, and for whom we willingly give. Then, their definition evolved again: friends are those with whom they're willing to invest time and energy to accomplish at least one thing together.

The author also quotes a saying commonly used by ancient gangsters: "Brothers are like hands and feet, wives are like clothes." They explain that the latter part of the saying is: "Clothes can be mended if torn, but how can severed hands and feet be restored?" This emphasizes that if you lose your wife, you can find another, but if you lose a brother, you can't get them back.

In discussing the process of family building, the author underscores the importance of growing together. They believe that both they and their wife need to continually improve and develop throughout their lives. They do many things together, such as family building, learning, and entertainment. Their next step is to have more children.

In summary, the author emphasizes the importance of time investment and growing together in a family, as well as the evolution of their definition of a friend. They believe these are key factors in family building and maintaining intimate relationships.
