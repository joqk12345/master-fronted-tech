# title : 伪专家

# chinese 

无论干什么，伪专家总是比真专家多许多倍，至少10倍。这个学校里的作文老师基本上都是伪专家，自己没有过像样的文章能够被发表、能够获得大量的认可，更不用提他们的出版著作了，但，他们的Title还真的就是作文老师，甚至比作文老师更为高级，叫做“语文老师”

No matter what you do, there are always way more pseudo-experts than genuine experts, at least ten times more. In this school, most of the composition teachers are basically pseudo-experts. They haven't had any decent articles published or gained significant recognition, let alone published works. But, their title is still "composition teacher," or even more advanced, they're called "language arts teachers.
