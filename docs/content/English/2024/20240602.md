# title 什么是有用的人

# chinese 

这段内容主要讨论了发展论与设计论的区别，并强调了发展论在长期目标上的优势。它指出，虽然设计论在短期内有其适用性，但从长远来看，发展论更为重要。课程的目标不是简单地提高孩子的在校成绩或让他们进入名牌大学，而是帮助家长和孩子理解学习的真正意义，并使他们能够持续地学习和成长。

课程的核心目标是帮助学习者尽早成熟，成为一个有用的人，而不仅仅是通过考试来衡量的硬技能，还包括生活中必需的软技能，如判断力、社交能力、沟通能力和组织能力等。课程强调，一个有用的人不仅对自己、家人、朋友和社会有用，而且能够适应发展的不确定性。

此外，内容还提到了教育应该以生产为导向，而不是仅仅培养合格的生产参与者。这表明教育应该更注重培养学生的主动生产和组织生产的能力。

总结提炼如下：
1. 发展论优于设计论，特别是在长期目标上。
2. 课程目标是帮助家长和孩子理解学习的真正意义，持续学习和成长。
3. 学习不仅仅是为了提高成绩或进入名牌大学，而是为了成为一个有用的人。
4. 有用的人不仅具备硬技能，还应具备判断力、社交能力、沟通能力和组织能力等软技能。
5. 教育应以生产为导向，培养学生的主动生产和组织生产的能力。

"This piece digs into the difference between developmentalism and designism, and it's all about how developmentalism has the upper hand in the long run. It's cool to see designism works for the short game, but in the big picture, developmentalism is where it's at."

"The course isn't just about boosting grades or getting into Ivy Leagues. It's about getting parents and kids to get the real scoop on learning and to keep the learning and growing vibes going."

"The heart of the course is to help learners grow up fast and be useful. It's not just about passing tests and hard skills, but also about the soft skills you need in life, like judgment, social skills, communication, and organization."

"A useful person is not just good for themselves and their close ones, but they can roll with the punches and adapt to the uncertainties of development."

"Plus, education should be about being productive, not just making good production participants. It's about fostering the drive to produce and organize production in students."

So here's the breakdown:

Developmentalism trumps designism, especially for the long haul.
The goal is to help parents and kids get the real deal on learning, keep on learning and growing.
Learning is about more than just grades or Ivy Leagues; it's about being useful.
A useful person packs both the hard and soft skills, like judgment, social skills, communication, and organization.
Education should be about production, nurturing the ability to produce and organize production in students.
