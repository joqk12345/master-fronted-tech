# title 《火星上的成长：一个虚构情境引发的思考》

# chinese 


假设在你的第一个孩子满十岁时，一位你素未谋面的富有远见的亿万富翁选中了她，让她加入首个火星永久人类定居点。她的学业成绩，再加上一份你不记得曾同意过的基因组分析，为她赢得了一个名额。你不知道的是，她自己报名参加了这个任务，因为她热爱外太空，而且她所有的朋友都报名了。她请求你让她去。

在说“不行”之前，你同意去了解更多信息。你了解到他们招募儿童的原因是儿童比成年人更能适应火星的特殊环境，尤其是低重力环境。如果孩子们在火星上经历青春期及其相关的生长突增，他们的身体将永久适应那里的环境，这与成年后才去火星的定居者不同。至少理论上是这样。目前还不清楚适应了火星环境的儿童是否还能返回地球。

你还发现了其他令人担忧的原因。首先是辐射。地球上的动植物是在磁层的保护下进化的，磁层阻挡或转移了大部分太阳风、宇宙射线和其他轰击我们星球的有害粒子流。火星没有这样的保护盾，因此会有更多的离子射穿你女儿身体每个细胞的 DNA。火星定居点项目的规划者根据对成年宇航员的研究为定居点建造了防护盾，成年宇航员在太空待一年后患癌症的风险会略有增加。但儿童面临的风险更高，因为他们的细胞正在发育和分化，细胞受损的几率会更高。规划者考虑到这一点了吗？他们到底有没有做过任何关于儿童安全的研究呢？就你所知，没有。

然后是重力问题。在漫长的岁月里，进化使每种生物的结构都适应了我们这颗特定星球上的重力。从出生起，每种生物的骨骼、关节、肌肉和心血管系统都会根据重力恒定的单向拉力而发育。消除这种持续的拉力会极大地影响我们的身体。在太空失重环境中待几个月的成年宇航员，他们的肌肉会变弱，骨骼密度会降低。他们的体液会聚集在不该聚集的地方，比如颅腔，这会给眼球带来压力并改变眼球的形状。火星有重力，但只有地球上孩子所受重力的 38%。在火星低重力环境中长大的孩子，其骨骼、心脏、眼睛和大脑都有很高的畸形发育风险。规划者考虑到儿童的这种脆弱性了吗？就你所知，没有。

那么，你会让她去吗？

当然不会。你意识到这是一个完全疯狂的想法——把孩子送到火星，也许他们再也回不了地球。为什么会有父母允许这样做呢？推动这个项目的公司急于在其他竞争对手之前在火星上确立自己的领地。公司的领导似乎对儿童发育一无所知，也似乎并不关心儿童的安全。更糟糕的是：公司并不要求提供父母同意的证明。只要孩子勾选一个表明她已获得父母同意的方框，她就可以飞向火星。

没有哪家公司可以在未经我们同意的情况下带走我们的孩子并让他们陷入危险，否则他们将面临巨大的责任，对吧？

At t h e t u r n o f t h e m i l l e n n i u m , technologycompaniesbasedonthe
West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products
that took advantage of the rapidly growing internet. There was a widely
shared sense of techno-optimism; these products made life easier, more fun,
and more productive. Some of them helped people to connect and
communicate, and therefore it seemed likely they would be a boon to the
growing number of emerging democracies. Coming soon after the fall of the
Iron Curtain, it felt like the dawn of a new age. The founders of these
companies were hailed as heroes, geniuses, and global benefactors who,
like Prometheus, brought gifts from the gods to humanity.
But the tech industry wasn’t just transforming life for adults. It began
transforming life for children too. Children and adolescents had been
watching a lot of television since the 1950s, but the new technologies were
far more portable, personalized, and engaging than anything that came
before. Parents discovered this truth early, as I did in 2008, when my two￾year-old son mastered the touch-and-swipe interface of my first iPhone.
Many parents were relieved to find that a smartphone or tablet could keep a
child happily engaged and quiet for hours. Was this safe? Nobody knew, but
because everyone else was doing it, everyone just assumed that it must be
okay.
Yet the companies had done little or no research on the mental health
effects of their products on children and adolescents, and they shared no
data with researchers studying the health effects. When faced with growing
evidence that their products were harming young people, they mostly
engaged in denial, obfuscation, and public relations campaigns.[3]
Companies that strive to maximize “engagement” by using psychological
tricks to keep young people clicking were the worst offenders. They hooked
children during vulnerable developmental stages, while their brains were
rapidly rewiring in response to incoming stimulation. This included social
media companies, which inflicted their greatest damage on girls, and video
game companies and pornography sites, which sank their hooks deepest
into boys.[4] By designing a firehose of addictive content that entered
through kids’ eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person
socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human
development on an almost unimaginable scale. The most intense period of
this rewiring was 2010 to 2015, although the story I will tell begins with the
rise of fearful and overprotective parenting in the 1980s and continues
through the COVID pandemic to the present day.
What legal limits have we imposed on these tech companies so far? In
the United States, which ended up setting the norms for most other
countries, the main prohibition is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
Act (COPPA), enacted in 1998. It requires children under 13 to get parental
consent before they can sign a contract with a company (the terms of
service) to give away their data and some of their rights when they open an
account. That set the effective age of “internet adulthood” at 13, for reasons
that had little to do with children’s safety or mental health.[5] But the
wording of the law doesn’t require companies to verify ages; as long as a
child checks a box to assert that she’s old enough (or puts in the right fake
birthday), she can go almost anywhere on the internet without her parents’
knowledge or consent. In fact, 40% of American children under 13 have
created Instagram accounts,[6] yet there has been no update of federal laws
since 1998. (The U.K., on the other hand, has taken some initial steps, as
have a few U.S. states.[7])
A few of these companies are behaving like the tobacco and vaping
industries, which designed their products to be highly addictive and then
skirted laws limiting marketing to minors. We can also compare them to the
oil companies that fought against the banning of leaded gasoline. In the
mid-20th century, evidence began to mount that the hundreds of thousands
of tons of lead put into the atmosphere each year, just by drivers in the
United States, were interfering with the brain development of tens of
millions of children, impairing their cognitive development and increasing
rates of antisocial behavior. Even still, the oil companies continued to
produce, market, and sell it.[8]
Of course, there is an enormous difference between the big social
media companies today and, say, the big tobacco companies of the mid-20th
century: Social media companies are making products that are useful for
adults, helping them to find information, jobs, friends, love, and sex;
making shopping and political organizing more efficient; and making life
easier in a thousand ways. Most of us would be happy to live in a world
with no tobacco, but social media is far more valuable, helpful, and even
beloved by many adults. Some adults have problems with addiction to
social media and other online activities, but as with tobacco, alcohol, or
gambling we generally leave it up to them to make their own decisions.
The same is not true for minors. While the reward-seeking parts of the
brain mature earlier, the frontal cortex—essential for self-control, delay of
gratification, and resistance to temptation—is not up to full capacity until
the mid-20s, and preteens are at a particularly vulnerable point in
development. As they begin puberty, they are often socially insecure, easily
swayed by peer pressure, and easily lured by any activity that seems to offer
social validation. We don’t let preteens buy tobacco or alcohol, or enter
casinos. The costs of using social media, in particular, are high for
adolescents, compared with adults, while the benefits are minimal. Let
children grow up on Earth first, before sending them to Mars.
