当我与青少年的父母交谈时，话题往往会转向智能手机、社交媒体和电子游戏。家长们向我讲述的故事通常遵循几种常见的模式。其中之一是“不断的冲突”故事：父母试图制定规则并实施限制，但因为有太多的设备，太多关于为何需要放宽规则的争论，以及太多绕过规则的方法，家庭生活已经被关于技术的分歧所主导。维持家庭仪式和基本的人际联系感觉就像是在抵抗不断上涨的潮水，这股潮水不仅淹没了孩子，也淹没了父母。

对于我交谈过的大多数父母而言，他们的故事并不集中在任何被诊断出的精神疾病上。相反，他们有一种潜在的担忧，认为有些不自然的事情正在发生，而且随着孩子们在线时间的增加，他们似乎错过了很多——实际上是几乎一切。

但有时家长们讲述的故事更为阴暗。父母们感觉自己失去了孩子。我在波士顿交谈的一位母亲讲述了她和丈夫为了不让十四岁的女儿艾米丽接触Instagram所做的努力。他们可以看到这给女儿带来的负面影响。为了限制她的使用，他们尝试了各种程序来监控和限制手机上的应用程序。然而，家庭生活演变成了一场持续的斗争，在这场斗争中，艾米丽最终找到了绕过这些限制的方法。在一个令人不安的事件中，她拿起了母亲的手机，禁用了监控软件，并威胁说如果父母重新安装它，她就会自杀。这位母亲告诉我：

感觉唯一能让她远离社交媒体和智能手机的方法就是搬到一个荒岛上。她每年夏天都会去参加为期六周的夏令营，在那里不允许使用任何电子设备。每次我们从营地接她回家时，她都是她正常的自我。但只要她再次开始使用手机，就又回到了同样的焦虑和沮丧状态。去年我把她的手机没收了两个月，给了她一部翻盖手机，她又恢复成了正常的自己。

THE SURGE OF SUFFERING
when I talk with parents of adolescents, the conversation often turns
to smartphones, social media, and video games. The stories parents
tell me tend to fall into a few common patterns. One is the “constant
conflict” story: Parents try to lay down rules and enforce limits, but there
are just so many devices, so many arguments about why a rule needs to be
relaxed, and so many ways around the rules, that family life has come to be
dominated by disagreements about technology. Maintaining family rituals
and basic human connections can feel like resisting an ever-rising tide, one
that engulfs parents as well as children.
For most of the parents I talk to, their stories don’t center on any
diagnosed mental illness. Instead, there is an underlying worry that
something unnatural is going on, and that their children are missing
something—really, almost everything—as their online hours accumulate.
But sometimes the stories parents tell me are darker. Parents feel that
they have lost their child. A mother I spoke with in Boston told me about
the efforts she and her husband had made to keep their fourteen-year-old
daughter, Emily,
[1] away from Instagram. They could see the damaging
effects it was having on her. To curb her access, they tried various programs
to monitor and limit the apps on her phone. However, family life devolved
into a constant struggle in which Emily eventually found ways around the
restrictions. In one distressing episode, she got into her mother’s phone,
disabled the monitoring software, and threatened to kill herself if her
parents reinstalled it. Her mother told me:
It feels like the only way to remove social media and the
smartphone from her life is to move to a deserted island. She
attended summer camp for six weeks each summer where no
phones were permitted—no electronics at all. Whenever we picked
her up from camp she was her normal self. But as soon as she
started using her phone again it was back to the same agitation and
glumness. Last year I took her phone away for two months and
gave her a flip phone and she returned to her normal self.
