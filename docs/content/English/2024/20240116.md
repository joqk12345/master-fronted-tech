“交易”是经济机器的最小结构， 简单理解经济总量就是交易的总和。你可以交易商品、服务或者是金融资产，你手头的现金和你能动用的信贷，就是你总体的消费能力，总体的消费能力驱动经济。经济机器在市场和交易的组合下开始运转，商品市场、楼市、股市、劳动力市场，只要有需求能交易就能构成市场。因此让个人和企业的消费能力增加，市场就会繁荣。

"Trades are the economy's building blocks; think of the whole economy as just a bunch of trades. You can swap goods, services, or financial assets. The cash you've got on hand and the credit you can tap into? That's your buying power, and it's what drives the economy. The economy gets rolling when markets and trades mesh together – whether it's for products, real estate, stocks, or jobs. If there's demand and folks can trade, you've got yourself a market. So, boost the spending power of people and businesses, and the market thrives."
