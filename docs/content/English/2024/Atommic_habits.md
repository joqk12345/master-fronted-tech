At the time, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly 100 years of mediocrity.

Since 1908,British rider had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic Games, and they had fared even worse in cycling's biggest race,the Tour de France, and 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.

 In fact , the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that  one of  the top bike manufacturers in Europ refused to  sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales of other professionals saw the brits using their gear.

Brailsford had been hired to put British cycling on a new trajectory.

What made him difference from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a stategy that he referred to as the aggregation of marginal gains ,which was the philosophy of searhing for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

Brailsford said by making small adjustments you might expect from a         professional cycling team.

They redesigned the bike seats to make them more comfortable and            rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better grip.

They asked riders to wear electrically heated overshoots to maintain        ideal muscle temperature while riding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each        athlete responded to a particular workout.

The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor riders switch to in door racing, which proved to be ligter and more aerodynamic.

but they didn't stop there.

Brailsford and  his team continued to find 1% improvements and overlooked in unexpected areas.

They tested different types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle recovery.
/ðeɪ tɛstɪd ˈdɪfərənt taɪps ʌv məˈsɑʒ ʤɛlz tu si wɪtʃ wʌn lɛd tu ðə ˈfæstɪst ˈmʌsəl rɪˈkʌvəri/

They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best way to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold.

They determined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best night’s sleep for each rider.

They even painted the inside of the team truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally slip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes.

## chapter 01 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits


### WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
[0308]
It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.

/ɪt ɪz soʊ ˈizi tuː ˌoʊvərˈɛstəˌmeɪt ðə ɪmˈpɔrtəns ʌv wʌn dɪˈfaɪnɪŋ ˈmoʊmənt ænd ˌʌndərˈɛstəˌmeɪt ðə ˈvæljuː ʌv ˈmeɪkɪŋ smɔl ɪmˈpruːvmənts ɑn ə ˈdeɪli ˈbeɪsɪs. tuː ˈɔfən, wi kənˈvɪns ˈɔrsɛlvz ðæt ˈmæsɪv səkˈsɛs rɪˈkwaɪrz ˈmæsɪv ˈækʃən. ˈwɛðər ɪt ɪz ˈluːzɪŋ weɪt, ˈbɪldɪŋ ə ˈbɪznəs, ˈraɪtɪŋ ə bʊk, ˈwɪnɪŋ ə ˈʧæmpɪənʃɪp, ɔr əˈʧivɪŋ ˈɛni ˈʌðər ɡoʊl, wi pʊt ˈprɛʃər ɑn ˈɔrsɛlvz tuː meɪk səm ˈɜrθˈʃætərɪŋ ɪmˈpruːvmənt ðæt ˈɛvrɪˌwʌn wɪl tɔːk əˈbaʊt./

[0311]
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.

Here's the phonemic transcription of the provided text:

/miːnˈwaɪl ɪmˈpruːvɪŋ baɪ wʌn pəˈsɛnt ˈɪznt pərˈtɪkjʊlərli ˈnoʊtəbl—ˈsʌmtaɪmz ɪt ˈɪznt ˈivən ˈnoʊtɪsəbl—bət ɪt kæn biː fɑr mɔr ˈmiːnɪŋfəl, ɪsˈpɛʃəli ɪn ðə lɔŋ rʌn. ðə ˈdɪfərəns ə ˈtaɪni ɪmˈpruːvmənt kæn meɪk ˈoʊvər taɪm ɪz əˈstaʊndɪŋ. hɪrz haʊ ðə mæθ wɜrks aʊt: ɪf ju kæn ɡɛt wʌn pəˈsɛnt ˈbɛtər ˈiʧ deɪ fɔr wʌn jɪr, jul ˈɛnd ʌp ˈθɜrti ˈsɛvən taɪmz ˈbɛtər baɪ ðə taɪm jʊr dʌn. ˈkɑnvɝsli, ɪf ju ɡɛt wʌn pəˈsɛnt wɜrs ˈiʧ deɪ fɔr wʌn jɪr, jul dɪˈklaɪn ˈnɪrli daʊn tu ˈziroʊ. wʌt stɑrts əz ə smɔl wɪn ɔr ə ˈmaɪnər ˈsɛtbæk əˈkjumjəˌleɪts ˈɪntu ˈsʌmθɪŋ mʌʧ mɔr./

[0312]
Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.

Here's the phonemic transcription of the provided text:

/hæbɪts ɑr ðə ˈkɑmpaʊnd ˈɪntrəst əv ˈsɛlf-ɪmˈpruv.mənt. ðə seɪm weɪ ðæt ˈmʌni ˈmʌltəˌplaɪz θruː ˈkɑmpaʊnd ˈɪntrəst, ðə ɪˈfɛkts əv jʊr ˈhæbɪts ˈmʌltəˌplaɪ æz juː rɪˈpiːt ðɛm. ðeɪ sim tuː meɪk ˈlɪtəl ˈdɪfərəns ɑn ˈɛni ˈɡɪvən ˈdeɪ ænd jɛt ðə ˈɪmpækt ðeɪ dɪˈlɪvər ˈoʊvər ðə ˈmʌnθs ænd jɪrz kæn biː ɪˈnɔr.məs. ɪt ɪz ˈoʊnli wɛn ˈlʊkɪŋ bæk tuː, faɪv, ɔr ˈpɜrhæps tɛn jɪrz ˈleɪtər ðæt ðə ˈvælju əv ɡʊd ˈhæbɪts ænd ðə kɔst əv bæd wənz bɪˈkʌmz ˈstraɪkɪŋli əˈpærənt./

- compound/ ˈkɑːmpaʊnd / adj.  复合的，混合的；以复利计算的
- multiplies / ˈmʌltɪplaɪz / 乘、 繁殖
- multiply /ˈmʌl.tə.plaɪ/v.  大大增加，倍增；乘，乘以；繁殖，滋生
- strikingly / ˈstraɪkɪŋli / adv.  显著地，突出地，引人注目地
- apparent/ əˈpærənt / adj.  显而易见的，易懂的；貌似的，表面上的


This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.

- concept / ˈkɑːnsept / n.  概念，观念
- appreciate / əˈpriːʃieɪt / v. 理解，明白；
- dismiss / dɪsˈmɪs /v.不考虑，不理会；驳回，停止受理
- millionaire /ˌmɪl.jəˈner/ /ˌmɪl.jəˈner/
- in a row 连续
- Mandarin/ ˈmændərɪn / n.  普通话
- slide / slaɪd / v 滑动
- slide back 滑回

Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss.

Unfortunately/ʌnˈfɔːr.tʃən.ət.li/
pace / peɪs /
procrastinate / prəˈkræstɪneɪt / v.  拖延，耽搁

[0314]
But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.

- replicating / ˈreplɪkeɪtɪŋ / n.  八音阶间隔的反复音；复制品 adj.  复制的 v.  复制（replicate 的 ing 形式）；折叠
- poor decision 糟糕的决定：一个不明智或错误的决策，可能导致负面后果。
- duplicating 美 / ˈdjʊpləˌket / v.  复制；重复；复印；使加倍（duplicate 的现在分词）
- rationalizing / ˈræʃnəlaɪzɪŋ / [数] 有理化
- rationalizing little excuses 为小借口找借口
- compound into 合并成：将两个或多个事物合并成一个更大的事物或系统。
- toxic / ˈtɑːksɪk / /ˈtɑːk.sɪk/  adj.  有毒的，引起中毒的；令人极不愉快的，极其有害的，恶毒的；中毒的，中毒性的；（财政）（债务）有毒的，风险高的；（证券）有毒的
- misstep / ˌmɪsˈstep / n.  失足；过失；踏错；失策vi.  失足；走上歧途
- decline / dɪˈklaɪn / v.  下降，衰退；拒绝，谢绝；变格，词形变化 n.  减少，衰退

The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.*

- shifting / ˈʃɪftɪŋ / v.  转移，挪动；快速移动；变换，更替；改变观点（或态度、做事方式等）；
- Los Angeles /ˌlɑːs ˈæn.dʒə.ləs/
- pilot /ˈpaɪ.lət/n.  飞行员；领航员；（船只的）领航员；（电视）试播节目；常燃小火；航海手册；<非正式>职业骑师；<古>向导；（火车头前端的）排障器
- heading / ˈhedɪŋ / n.  方向，航向；
- takeoff / ˈteɪkˌɔːf / n.  （飞机、直升机等的）起飞；（经济、生意等的）开始腾飞，迅速发展；
- nose / noʊz / n. (飞机、火箭等的）头部，机首；
- magnified / ˈmæɡnɪfaɪd / adj.  放大的 v.  放大；增大；夸大，夸张（magnify 的过去式和过去分词）
- miles / maɪlz / n.  英里（1英里约合1609米, mile 的复数形式）

[0315] 
Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

- slight / slaɪt / adj.  轻微的，少量的；（人）瘦小的，纤弱的；（尤指创作）不深奥的，不重要的
- choice / tʃɔɪs / n.  选择，抉择；选择的机会，选择权；
- guide / ɡaɪd / v. 带领，引导（某人至某地）；任向导；指导，影响；解释，阐明
- insignificant / ˌɪnsɪɡˈnɪfɪkənt / adj.  微不足道的，无足轻重的；（人）无权无势的；无意义的

That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to end well. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re moving slower than you’d like.

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

- lagging / ˈlæɡɪŋ / adj.  落后的，发展滞后的
- clutter / ˈklʌtər / n.  杂乱的东西；杂乱

If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.

- losses/ lɔːsɪz / n.  损失；损耗（loss 的复数）
- battles / ˈbætlz / n.  战争；竞争（battle 的复数）

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

- magnify / ˈmæɡnɪfaɪ / v.  放大，扩大；夸张，夸大；使（问题）加重，加剧；<古>赞美，颂扬
- margin / ˈmɑːrdʒɪn / n.  页边空白；差额，幅度；盈余，利润；余地，备用的时间（或空间、金钱等）；边缘，
- multiply / ˈmʌltɪplaɪ / v.  大大增加，倍增；乘，乘以；繁殖，滋生
- ally / ˈælaɪ / n.  同盟国；盟友，支持者；辅助物，助手
- enemy / ˈenəmi / n.  敌人，反对者；敌国，敌军；大敌，危害物

Habits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.

- liking/ ˈlaɪkɪŋ / n.  嗜好，爱好，喜好
- blade/ bleɪd / n.  刀片，刀刃；（草，小麦等的）叶片；（船或飞机螺旋桨的）桨叶；（溜冰鞋的）冰刀；<旧>花花公子，时髦男士；<文>剑；肩胛骨，肩胛；舌身

### WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE

[0316]
Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.

Twenty-six degrees.

Twenty-seven.

Twenty-eight.

The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.

Twenty-nine degrees.

Thirty.

Thirty-one.

Still, nothing has happened.

Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.

- cube / kjuːb / n.  立方体；立方，三次幂；<美，非正式>小室，小房间
- seemingly / ˈsiːmɪŋli / adv.  貌似，看似（但可能并非如此）；似乎，好像（是事实）
- temperature / ˈtemprətʃər; ˈtemprətʃʊr / n.  温度，气温；体温；发烧；热烈程度，情绪激烈程度
- shift / ʃɪft / n.  改变，转变；轮班工作时间；轮班工作的人；（

Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.

- unleash / ʌnˈliːʃ / v.  释放出，发泄（力量、感情等）；解开皮带放开（动物）；放开，解除对……的限制
- undetectable / ˌʌndɪˈtektəbl / adj.  看不见的，察觉不出的；探测不到的
- Bamboo / ˌbæmˈbuː / 竹，竹子；（制手杖或家具、器具用的）竹竿，竹筒
- extensive / ɪkˈstensɪv / adj.  广阔的；广泛的；巨大的，大量的；
- exploding/ ɪkˈsploʊdɪŋ / n.  爆炸；爆发
- show up 显露，显示：明显存在或显露出来。

Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

- threshold / ˈθreʃhoʊld / n.  门槛，门口；阈，界，起始点；开端，
- quest / kwest / n.  <文>（长久或辛勤的）寻求，探求；（中世纪传奇故事中骑士的）探险
- frustrating / ˈfrʌstreɪtɪŋ / adj.  令人懊恼的，令人沮丧的
- hallmark / ˈhɔːlmɑːrk / n.  特点，特征；（金银制品上标明纯度及制作时间、地点的）印记

This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.

- plateau /plætˈoʊ/ n.  高原；（发展、增长后的）稳定期，停滞期；高原印第安人；托盘
- tangible / ˈtændʒəb(ə)l / adj.  明确的，真实的；可触摸的，可感知的
- Latent / ˈleɪt(ə)nt / adj.  （性质，状态）潜在的，隐藏的；（芽、静止期等）休眠的，潜伏的；
- Potential / pəˈtenʃ(ə)l / adj.  潜在的，可能的

If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

- Complaining/ kəmˈpleɪnɪŋ / v.  抱怨；（诗、文）悲叹；投诉；
- heated/ ˈhiːtɪd / v.  加热，使变暖；<古>激起，使激动（he

When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t making any progress—that makes the jump today possible.

- overnight  / ˌoʊvərˈnaɪt / adj.  夜间的，只供一夜的；突然的，一夜之间的
- dramatic 美 / drəˈmætɪk / adj.  巨大而突然的，急剧的；激动人心的，引人注目的，给人深刻印象的；有关戏剧的，戏剧表演的；夸张的
- preceded v．在……之前发生；先于；领先

It is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic plates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension slowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once again, in the same fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it happens all at once.

- equivalent /ɪˈkwɪv.əl.ənt/adj.  等同的，等效的
- geological  ˌdʒiːəˈlɑːdʒɪk(ə)l / adj.  地质的，地质学的
- tectonic / tekˈtɑːnɪk / [地质] 构造的；建筑的；地壳构造上的
- plates / pleɪts / n.  盘子（plate 的复数）；板材；[建]平板
- grind / ɡraɪnd / v.  磨碎，碾碎；使锋利；
- tension / ˈtenʃ(ə)n / n.  紧张，焦虑；紧张关系，紧张局势；矛盾，冲突；
- rub / rʌb / v.  擦，磨擦；揉擦，按摩（尤指疼痛部位）；
- erupt / ɪˈrʌpt / v.  喷发；爆发，突然发生；（感情）迸发；（斑疹等）突然冒出；长牙

Mastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”

- hammering / ˈhæmərɪŋ / n.  锤击；锤打；抨击

### THE PLATEAU OF LATENT POTENTIAL
[0317]
All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.

- sprout/ spraʊt / v.  （植物）发芽，抽条；（毛发等）生长，长出；涌现，突然出现；从表面凸出
- entrench 美 / ɪnˈtrentʃ / v.  使（权力、习俗、观念等）根深蒂固；把（军队，兵营等）置于壕沟（或其他设防的阵地）中；<古>侵犯，侵占（entrench on/upon）；运用其他法律保障（法律赋予的权利，
- uprooting / ˌʌpˈruːtɪŋ / v.  连根拔起；根除（uproot 的 ing 形式）
- oak / oʊk / n.  橡树，栎树；橡木，栎木；
- cultivating / ˈkʌltɪveɪtɪŋ / v.  培养（cultivate 的现在分词）
- delicate / ˈdelɪkət / adj.  柔和的，清淡的；虚弱的，纤弱的；脆弱的，易碎的；小巧玲珑的，纤细的；微妙的，棘手的；精致的，精巧的；灵巧的，熟练的；（仪器）灵敏的

But what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to survive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other side? What is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habits and enables others to enjoy the compounding effects of good ones?

### FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD

Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—is to set specific, actionable goals.

Prevailing / prɪˈveɪlɪŋ / adj.  现存的，存在的； 风靡的，盛行的
shape / ʃeɪp / n. 身体状况；健壮；
actionable / ˈækʃənəbl / adj.  可控告的；可提起诉讼的
specific actionable goals 具体可行的目录

For many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each one was a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I wanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of them. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.

profits / ˈprɑːfɪts / n.  [会计]收益，红利；盈利（profit 的复数）

What’s the difference between systems and goals? It’s a distinction I first learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbert comic. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

- distinction / dɪˈstɪŋkʃn / n.  差别，区分；杰出，卓越；特点；荣誉
- cartoonist / kɑːrˈtuːnɪst / n.  漫画家，动画片画家
- Dilbert n.  呆伯特（卡通人物，身居斗室的生意圈里的平庸之辈）
- comic / ˈkɑːmɪk / adj.  滑稽的，好笑的；喜剧的n.  喜剧演员；连环漫画


If you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice.

- recruit / rɪˈkruːt / v.  招聘，招收（新成员）；招募（新兵）；说服，动员； 

If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.

- entrepreneur / ˌɑːntrəprəˈnɜːr / n.  企业家，创业者；主办者，提倡者
- campaign / kæmˈpeɪn / n.  （有计划的）活动，运动；战役，战斗

If you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your system is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your instructor.

- tackle / ˈtæk(ə)l / v.  应付，解决（难题或局面）；与……交涉；（
- instructor / ɪnˈstrʌktər / n.  教练，导师；<美>大学讲师

Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get results?

I think you would.

The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

- ridiculous  rɪˈdɪkjələs / adj.  可笑的，荒谬的
- scoreboard / ˈskɔːrbɔːrd / n.  记分板，记分牌
- The score takes care of itself 分数是自然的

What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems


### A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS

If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings behind the word atomic. By now, you’ve probably realized that an atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.

Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.


## chapter2 How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
WHY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones? Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits. And yet it is likely that this time next year you’ll be doing the same thing rather than something better.

It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.

However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best intentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much television, procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.

Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. In this chapter, I’ll address the first point. In the chapters that follow, I’ll answer the second.

Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. To understand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which change can occur. You can imagine them like the layers of an onion.


### THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE

The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.

The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.

- meditation / ˌmedɪˈteɪʃ(ə)n / n.  冥想，打坐；沉思，深思；（关于某主题的）感想，沉思录

The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.

- assumption / əˈsʌmpʃ(ə)n / n.  假定，假设；取得，承担

Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. When it comes to building habits that last—when it comes to building a system of 1 percent improvements—the problem is not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another. All levels of change are useful in their own way. The problem is the direction of change.

Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.

Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs.

- cigarette.  / ˈsɪɡəret / n.  香烟，纸烟；麻醉烟，草药烟，药性烟

The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.

Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.

- skinny / ˈskɪni / adj.  极瘦的，皮包骨的；（衣服）紧身的；<非正式>低脂肪的，加脱脂奶的
- sabotage / ˈsæbətɑːʒ / v.  蓄意破坏，故意毁坏；妨碍，捣乱，阻挠 n.  蓄意毁坏；刻意阻碍

Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of a democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and social equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of beliefs like absolute authority and strict obedience. You can imagine many ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such behavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship. That’s not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.

- dictatorship / ˌdɪkˈteɪtərʃɪp /n.  专政；独裁权；独裁者职位
- authority / əˈθɔːrəti / n.  专家，权威人士；行政管理机构；
- obedience / əˈbiːdiəns / n.  服从，遵从

A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals, organizations, or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits.

Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather than training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.

- incongruent / ˌɪnˈkɑːŋɡrʊənt / adj.  不一致的；不协调的；不和谐的；不合适的
- drawn / drɔːn / v.  画，绘制；

The story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado, provides a good example. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve chewed my fingernails,” Clark told me. “It started as a nervous habit when I was young, and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit. Through mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”

- Boulder, Colorado 科罗拉多博尔德
- chewed  / tʃuː / v.  咀嚼，嚼碎；（为了品尝或因紧张而）不停地嚼，咬； 
- fingernails / ˈfɪŋɡərneɪl / n.  手指甲 
- morph / mɔːrf / v.  （使）图像变形；将（图像）进行合成处理；改变，变化，变形 
- grooming / ˈɡruːmɪŋ / n.  （动物）刷洗，梳毛；梳妆；培养；（以实施性侵为目的的）儿童诱骗
- ritual/ ˈrɪtʃuəl / n.  （宗教等的）仪式，典礼；习惯，例行公事；

Then, Clark did something surprising.

“I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,” he said. “My thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’t chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the first time. The manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I had really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my fingernails. And even though that’s something I had never aspired to, it made all the difference. I’ve never chewed my nails since; not even a single close call. And it’s because I now take pride in properly caring for them.”

- manicure/ ˈmænɪkjʊr / n.  修指甲，美甲，指甲护理
- aspire / əˈspaɪər / v.  渴望，有志于

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.

- intrinsic / ɪnˈtrɪnzɪk / adj.  内在的，固有的

The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.

- biceps / ˈbaɪseps / n.  二头肌（尤指肱二头肌和股二头肌）
- upper-body 上半身：通常指从腰部以上的身体部位，包括胸部、肩膀、手臂和颈部。
- scarves/ skɑːrvz / n.  围巾；领带
- knit / nɪt / v.  编织，针织；织平针；（

True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.

The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.

- marathon / ˈmærəθɑːn / n.  马拉松赛跑；马拉松式的活动（或工作）

The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. For example, people who identified as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than those who simply claimed “voting” was an action they wanted to perform. Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identity doesn’t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.

- indication / ˌɪndɪˈkeɪʃ(ə)n / n.  指示，标示；象征，暗示，迹象
- consciously / ˈkɑːnʃəsli / adv.  有意识地，清楚地；有意地，故意地
- nonconsciously. adv.  无意识地，非意识地
- claimed/ kleɪmd / v.  声称；宣称；断言（claim 的过去式）
- incorporate / ɪnˈkɔːrpəreɪt / adj.  合成一体的，合并的；具体化的；组成公司（或社团）的
- convince / kənˈvɪns / v.  使确信，使信服；说服，劝服
- pursuing / pərˈsʊ / v.  从事；追赶（pursue 的现在分词）


Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity.

- formation  fɔːrˈmeɪʃ(ə)n / n.  组成物；构成；形成，产生；编队，队形；（社会、政治等的）形态
- curse / kɜːrs / n.  骂人话，咒骂语；咒语，魔咒；祸根，祸因；月经，例假（the curse）
- adopted / əˈdɑːptɪd / v.  收养；采取，采纳，接受；正式通过
- allegiance / əˈliːdʒəns / n.  （对政党、宗教、统治者的）忠诚，效忠，拥戴
- cognitive / ˈkɑːɡnətɪv / adj.  认识的，认知的
- slumber / ˈslʌmbər / n.  睡眠；麻木状态；静止状态

“I’m terrible with directions.”

“I’m not a morning person.”

“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”

“I’m always late.”

“I’m not good with technology.”

“I’m horrible at math.”

. . . and a thousand other variations.

When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.

- grooves / ɡruːvz / n.  细槽，[建]凹槽（groove 的复数）
- slide into / slaɪd ˈɪntu /悄悄地进入或加入某个群体或情境中，通常是为了避免引起注意或不必要的麻烦：指悄悄地进入或加入某个群体或情境中，通常是为了避免引起注意或不必要的麻烦。
- in time及时地；准时地：在某个特定的时间之前或之内。
- contradict / ˌkɑːntrəˈdɪkt / v.  反驳，否认；相抵触，相矛盾；发生矛盾
- self-image/ ˌself ˈɪmɪdʒ / n.  自我形象

The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

- uphold / ʌpˈhoʊld / v.  支持，维护（法规、制度或原则）；认可，维持（法院原判）；鼓励；举起
- positive / ˈpɑːzətɪv / adj.  乐观的，有信心的；积极的，建设性的；良好的，有助益的；赞成的，支持的；确信的，肯定的；完全的，绝对的；证据确凿的，明确的；阳性的；正数的，大于零的；正电的，正极的；（摄影）正片的，正像的；（语法）（形容词，副词）原级的；（主哲）实证的，实在的；（占星）（风宫，火宫）积极的
- rational / ˈræʃ(ə)nəl / adj.  （想法、决定等）合理的，基于理性的；（人）理性的，理智的；富有理性的；（数）有理的，有理数的
- tied to 与……有关联：指某事物与另一事物之间存在紧密的联系或依赖关系。

On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

- overwhelmed / ˌoʊvərˈwelmd / adj.  被压倒的，被淹没的；（强烈地影响而使） 不知所措的
- in the way / ɪn ðə weɪ / 阻碍，妨碍：阻止或干扰某人或某事物的移动或进展。
- attached / əˈtætʃt / adj.  非常喜欢……的，热爱……的；为……工作的；隶属于……，附属的；连接的，附加的

This brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and worldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do they come from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed? And how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and gradually erase the pieces that hinder you?

- hinder ˈhɪndər / v.  阻碍，妨碍

### THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY

Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.*

- emerge / ɪˈmɜːrdʒ / v.  浮现，出现；显露，知悉；恢复过来，幸存下来；形成，兴起
- preset / ˌpriːˈset / v.  预调，预置； 预先决定，事先安排；预先设置，预调（设备）
- conditioned / kənˈdɪʃnd / adj.  有条件的，受制约的；习惯于……的

More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.

- precisely / prɪˈsaɪsli / adv.  精确地，准确地；恰好，正是（表示强调）；（用于表示完全同意）的确如此；严谨地，细致地
- embody / ɪmˈbɑːdi / v.  具体表现，体现；收录，包括；<古>（尤指为军事目的）组织
- athletic / æθˈletɪk / adj.  运动的，体育的；强壮的，健壮的；运动员用的；（在体育、比赛或身体锻炼等方面）行动敏捷的，活跃的

The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”

- reinforce美 / ˌriːɪnˈfɔːrs / v.  加强，强化（观点、思想或感觉）；加固，使更结实；给……加强力量（或装备），增援；寻求（或得到）增援
- derived / dɪˈraɪvd / adj.  导出的；衍生的，派生的
- beingness 存在的性质

Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you have evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour every night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed to fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.

- church/ tʃɜːrtʃ / n.  教堂；礼拜仪式；教派，教会
- religious / rɪˈlɪdʒəs / adj.  宗教的，与宗教相关的；笃信宗教的，虔诚的；极其严谨的，十分认真的；<非正式>小心的，谨慎的 ；<非正式>对……很感兴趣的，热衷……的
- studious / ˈstuːdiəs / adj.  用功的；热心的；专心的；故意的；适于学习的

For most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a writer. If you were to ask any of my high school teachers or college professors, they would tell you I was an average writer at best: certainly not a standout. When I began my writing career, I published a new article every Monday and Thursday for the first few years. As the evidence grew, so did my identity as a writer. I didn’t start out as a writer. I became one through my habits.

Of course, your habits are not the only actions that influence your identity, but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most important ones. Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but it’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.

- virtue/ ˈvɜːrtʃuː / n.  高尚的道德，德行；美德，优秀品质；优点，长处；
- self image/ ˌself ˈɪmɪdʒ / 自我形象：一个人对自己的形象、特点和价值的认知和评价。
- soccer / ˈsɑːkər / n.  英式足球，足球
- scribbled / ˈskrɪbld / v.  乱画；潦草地书写；写作（非正式）
- one-off adj.  一次性的

This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.

- snapping / ˈsnæpɪŋ / adv.  强烈地；显著地

Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are the type of person who likes music.

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.

- radical / ˈrædɪk(ə)l / adj.  根本的，彻底的；激进的，极端的；全新的，不同凡响的；（增减）急剧的，大幅度的；（人，物）原本的，与生俱来的；<美，非正式>顶呱呱的；（外科，医疗）根治的；<英，史>（19世纪）自由党激进派的；（数）根式的，根号的；词根的；（植）根生的 
- paradox / ˈpærədɑːks / n.  矛盾的人（或事物、情况）；似非而是的隽语，悖论；悖论修辞

Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.

Each time you write a page, you are a writer.

Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.

- violin / ˌvaɪəˈlɪn / n.  小提琴；小提琴手

Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.

- workout / ˈwɜːrkaʊt / n.  锻炼，训练；试验

Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.

Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.

- accomplish / əˈkɑːmplɪʃ / v.  完成，实现

Of course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is that you don’t need to be perfect. In any election, there are going to be votes for both sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.

- unanimous / juˈnænɪməs / adj.  （投票、决定、协议等）全体同意的，无异议的；（所有人）一致同意的，意见一致的
- election / ɪˈlekʃ(ə)n / n.  选举；当选；选举权；上帝的选拔
- votes / voʊts / n.  选票；选举；得票数（vote 的复数形式）
- majority / məˈdʒɔːrəti / n.  大多数；<英>多数票；成年的法定年龄；多数党；少校军衔，少校职位

New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.

- identities / aɪˈdentɪtiz / 身份
- cast / kæst / 投票；

It is a simple two-step process:

Decide the type of person you want to be.

Prove it to yourself with small wins.

First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become?

These are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to begin—but they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack abs or to feel less anxious or to double their salary. That’s fine. Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of person who could get those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn a new language? Who is the type of person that could run a successful start-up?

- six-pack/ ˈsɪks pæk / n.  六瓶装；（非正式）隆起的腹肌
- abs / æbz / n.  （非正式）腹肌（同abdominals）
- six-pack abs 六块腹肌：指腹部肌肉发达，形成六块明显的腹肌。
- anxious / ˈæŋkʃəs / adj.  焦虑的，担心的；渴望的，急切的；（时间或局势）紧张的，令人焦虑的
- backward / ˈbækwərd / adj.  向后的，朝后的；倒退的；落后的；迟钝的

For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).

- consistent / kənˈsɪstənt / adj.  始终如一的，一贯的；持续的，连续的；固守的，坚持的；一致的，吻合的

This process can lead to beliefs like:

“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.”

“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and empathy they need.”

- empathy / ˈempəθi / n.  共鸣，同情；感同身受，产生共鸣（的能力）

“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”

- advocates/ ˈædvəkeɪts / vt.  主张，提倡（advocate 的第三人称单数）

Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy person do?” All day long, she would use this question as a guide. Would a healthy person walk or take a cab? Would a healthy person order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person. She was right.

- take a cab / teɪk ə kæb / 乘坐出租车：使用出租车作为交通工具。
- burrito / bʊˈriːtoʊ / n.  玉米煎饼
- salad / ˈsæləd / n.  色拉；尤指莴苣
- figured / ˈfɪɡjərd / v.  是……的重要部分；认为；

The concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to another key theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

### THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER
Identity change is the North Star of habit change. The remainder of this book will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to build better habits in yourself, your family, your team, your company, and anywhere else you wish. But the true question is: “Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And that’s why we are starting here.
- quest / kwest / v.  <文>探寻，寻求 
- rudder / ˈrʌdər / n.  船舵；飞机方向舵
You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter.

Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks. It’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about achieving external measures of success like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone.

- floss / flɑːs / vt.  用牙线洁牙
- shower / ˈʃaʊər / n.  淋浴器，花洒；淋浴间，淋浴室；淋浴，洗澡
- outfit / ˈaʊtfɪt / n.  （尤指在某一场合穿的）全套服装；全套工具，全套设备；
- external / ɪkˈstɜːrn(ə)l / adj.  外部的，外面的；对外的，与外国有关的；外来的，外聘的；
- earning / ˈɜːrnɪŋ / v.  赚得( earn的现在分词 )；挣钱；生（利）；获（利）
 
Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.

## chapter 3. How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

IN 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment that would lay the foundation for our understanding of how habits form and the rules that guide our behavior. Thorndike was interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by working with cats.

- Thorndike / ˈθɔːrndaɪk / n.  桑代克（姓氏）

He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The box was designed so that the cat could escape through a door “by some simple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a platform.” For example, one box contained a lever that, when pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.

- lever / ˈlevər / n.  （车辆或机器的）操纵杆，控制杆；杠杆；（用于达到某一目的的）手段，
- dart out突然冲出：迅速地从某个地方突然冲出或跳出。
- dart / dɑːrt / v.  飞奔，猛冲；瞥，急扫（一眼）；（

Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through openings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes of exploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever, the door would open, and they would escape.

- poke / poʊk / v.  （用手指或尖利物品）戳，刺；从……露出（或伸出、探出）；把……戳进，
- paws / pɔːz / n.  （复数）爪子；〈
- stick / stɪk / v.  放置；
- claw / klɔː / v.  （用爪）撕，抓；挠痒；（帆船）迎风而行

Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food.

After twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example, Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act. 160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”

- habitual / həˈbɪtʃuəl / adj.  习惯性的，惯常的；上瘾的

During the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes. During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds. With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and more automatic. Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.

From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating, “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.” His work provides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form in our own lives. It also provides answers to some fundamental questions like: What are habits? And why does the brain bother building them at all?

### WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.

- formation / fɔːrˈmeɪʃ(ə)n / n.  组成物；构成；形成，产生；编队，队形；

Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You are carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act. You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action.

- neurological / ˌnʊrəˈlɑːdʒɪkl / adj.  神经病学的，神经学上的
- conscious / ˈkɑːnʃəs / adj.  意识到的；神志清醒的，有知觉的；关注的；刻意的，慎重的

Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution. You’re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run calms you down. You’re mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and you learn that playing video games relaxes you. You’re exploring, exploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.

- Occasionally / əˈkeɪʒ(ə)nəli / adv.  偶然，偶尔
- anxious / ˈæŋkʃəs / adj.  焦虑的，担心的；渴望的，急切的；（时间或局势）紧张的，令人焦虑的
- stumble / ˈstʌmb(ə)l / v.  绊脚，绊跌；跌跌撞撞地走，蹒跚而行；结结巴巴地说；偶然发现；（
- exhausted / ɪɡˈzɔːstɪd / adj.  筋疲力尽的；耗尽的，枯竭的
- BAM 嘭，

After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward. Wait a minute—that felt good. What did I do right before that?

- strategy / ˈstrætədʒi /n.  （尤指为获得某物制定长期的）策略，行动计划；战略，战略学
- catalog / ˈkætəlɔːɡ / vt.  登记；为……编目录
- preceded v．在……之前发生；先于；领先

This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.

Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly. As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”

- stress / stres / n.  精神压力，紧张；压力，应力；强调，重要性；（单词）重音，重读，（音乐）加强音；压强；环境恶劣引起的疾病
- recurring / rɪˈkɜːrɪŋ / adj.  反复出现，再次发生；循环小数的；经常性的
- regularly / ˈreɡjələrli / adv.  定期地，有规律地；频繁地，经常地；均匀地，匀称地；

As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate. Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run. As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the video game controller. A choice that once required effort is now automatic. A habit has been created.

- lock in 锁定：指将某人或某物固定在特定位置或状态，使其无法移动或改变。
- tune / tuːn / v.  （给乐器）调音，校音；（给收音机、电视等）调谐，调频道；调整，调节（发动机）；调整，使适合；<南非，非正式>告诉
- tune out v.  关掉；不理睬
- trial / ˈtraɪəl /n.  审判，审理；试验，试用；（
- trial and error 试错法：通过尝试一种或多种方法或手段，并注意和消除错误或失败原因来找到达到期望结果或正确解决方案的最佳方法的过程。
- cognitive  ˈkɑːɡnətɪv / adj.  认识的，认知的
- "Cognitive scripts" 是指认知脚本，也称为认知模式或认知图式。它们是人们在日常生活中使用的自动化思维模式，用于处理特定情境或完成特定任务。
- appropriate / əˈproʊpriət / adj.  合适的，相称的

Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.

[0325]
Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.

- preserve / prɪˈzɜːrv / v.  保护，维护；保持，维持；腌制，保存（食物）；禁止他人捕猎
- conscious / ˈkɑːnʃəs / adj.  意识到的；神志清醒的，有知觉的；关注的；刻意的，慎重的
- conscious mind 意识心智：指一个人在任何时候意识到自己拥有的思想和感受。
- conscious attention 有意识注意

- pawn / pɑːn / vt.  当掉；以……担保
- pawn off 推卸责任：通过欺骗手段摆脱或推卸责任。
- precisely / prɪˈsaɪsli / adv.  精确地，准确地；恰好，正是（表示强调）；
- cognitive load 认知负荷：指个体工作记忆资源的使用量。
- mental capacity / ˈmentl kəˈpæsəti / 智力能力：指一个人的智力水平和能力，包括思考、理解、记忆、解决问题等方面。
- capacity / kəˈpæsəti / n.  能力，才能；容积，容纳能力；职位，职责；功率，容积；生产量，生产能力

Despite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits of habits. The argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull? I don’t want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy. Doesn’t so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?” Hardly. Such questions set up a false dichotomy. They make you think that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom. In reality, the two complement each other.

- dull / dʌl / adj.  枯燥无聊的；无精打采的；不明亮的；
- pigeonhole / ˈpɪdʒɪnhoʊl / vt.  分类；把……留在记忆中；缓办；把……隔成小格
- vibrancy / ˈvaɪbrənsi / n.  振动；活力
- spontaneity / ˌspɑːntəˈneɪəti / n.  自发性，自然；自发行为
- dichotomy / daɪˈkɑːtəmi / n.  二分法；两分；分裂；双歧分枝
- attaining / əˈteɪnɪŋ / v.  获得；实现；达到（attain 的现在分词）
- complement / ˈkɑːmplɪment / n.  补足物，衬托物；足数，足额；补语；余角；补体，防御素

Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind the curve. If you’re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks—when should I work out, where do I go to write, when do I pay the bills—then you have less time for freedom. It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.

- restrict / rɪˈstrɪkt / v.  限制，控制（大小、数量、范围）；限制（活动或行为），妨碍；约束，管束；
- least / liːst / adj.  一点儿；最少的（little 的最高级）；最微不足道的（little 的最高级形式）

Conversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.

- dialed in 调整或精确地设置某物以达到最佳效果的过程已经完成，或者已经达到了最佳效果
- dial / ˈdaɪəl / n.  钟面，仪表盘；调节器；

### THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK

The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.* Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it.

This four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain runs through these steps in the same order each time.

First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction, which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)

Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external environment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.

Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.

Cravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece of information could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not motivated by the same cues. For a gambler, the sound of slot machines can be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. For someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.

The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high enough to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck.

Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards provide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you need to survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and respect. Getting in shape improves your health and your dating prospects. But the more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat or to gain status or to win approval. At least for a moment, rewards deliver contentment and relief from craving.

Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.

If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.

This four-step process is not something that happens occasionally, but rather it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active during every moment you are alive—even now. The brain is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results. The entire process is completed in a split second, and we use it again and again without realizing everything that has been packed into the previous moment.

We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire.

All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.

In the table on the following page, you can see a few examples of what this looks like in real life.

Imagine walking into a dark room and flipping on the light switch. You have performed this simple habit so many times that it occurs without thinking. You proceed through all four stages in the fraction of a second. The urge to act strikes you without thinking.

By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are running our lives. Most of us never give a second thought to the fact that we tie the same shoe first each morning, or unplug the toaster after each use, or always change into comfortable clothes after getting home from work. After decades of mental programming, we automatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.



### THE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE

In the following chapters, we will see time and again how the four stages of cue, craving, response, and reward influence nearly everything we do each day. But before we do that, we need to transform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.

I refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones. You can think of each law as a lever that influences human behavior. When the levers are in the right positions, creating good habits is effortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.
