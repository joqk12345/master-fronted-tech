At the time, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly 100 years of mediocrity.

Since 1908,British rider had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic Games, and they had fared even worse in cycling's biggest race,the Tour de France, and 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.

 In fact , the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that  one of  the top bike manufacturers in Europ refused to  sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales of other professionals saw the brits using their gear.

Brailsford had been hired to put British cycling on a new trajectory.

What made him difference from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a stategy that he referred to as the aggregation of marginal gains ,which was the philosophy of searhing for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

Brailsford said by making small adjustments you might expect from a         professional cycling team.

They redesigned the bike seats to make them more comfortable and            rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better grip.

They asked riders to wear electrically heated overshoots to maintain        ideal muscle temperature while riding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each        athlete responded to a particular workout.

The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor riders switch to in door racing, which proved to be ligter and more aerodynamic.

but they didn't stop there.

Brailsford and  his team continued to find 1% improvements and overlooked in unexpected areas.

They tested different types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle recovery.

They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best way to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold.

They determined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best night’s sleep for each rider.
/ðeɪ dɪˈtɜrmɪnd ðə taɪp ʌv ˈpɪloʊ ænd ˈmætrəs ðæt lɛd tu ðə bɛst naɪts slip fɔr iːʧ ˈraɪdər/

They even painted the inside of the team truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally slip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes.
