## How to impove English speaking skills

The sources discuss how to improve English speaking skills, focusing on the importance of practice, **content over pronunciation**, and **accumulating conversation materials**. They emphasize that the goal of learning spoken English is effective communication, not grammatical perfection.

Here's a breakdown of the concepts and their connections:

**1. Learning Zone vs. Performance Zone:**

- Learning Zone = To improve, make mistakes 
- Performance Zone = To impress, minimize errors 
- Many English learners mistakenly apply the Performance Zone mindset to the Learning Zone, hindering progress due to fear of mistakes 

**2. Fluency ≠ Pronunciation:**

- People often equate good English speaking with good pronunciation 
- While pronunciation is important, fluency encompasses conveying meaning effectively, even with imperfections.
- Focus on content and expressing your thoughts clearly, even if your pronunciation isn't perfect .

**3. Overcoming Fear of Mistakes:**

- Embrace mistakes as part of the learning process .
- Shift your mindset from avoiding errors to actively practicing and learning from them .
- Don't let the fear of making mistakes prevent you from practicing and improving .

**4. Content over Complexity:**

- It's better to express a complex idea simply than to get stuck searching for the perfect word or grammar .
- Prioritize clear communication over using sophisticated vocabulary or grammar .
- Start with familiar expressions and gradually build your vocabulary and grammar.

**5. Gathering Conversation Material:**

- Identify topics you're passionate about.
- Use websites like Quora and IMDb to learn how native speakers express their opinions and engage in discussions .
- Watch interview shows to observe real-life conversations and learn from them .
- Create your own "spoken English book" by collecting phrases, expressions, and topics you encounter.

**6. The Importance of Action:**

\*  Knowledge without action is useless; actively practice and apply what you learn .

\*  Don't fall into the trap of constantly seeking new learning materials without putting in the effort to practice.

\*  Consistent effort and practice are crucial for improvement .

By understanding these interconnected concepts, you can develop a more effective approach to improving your English speaking skills.

## Prepare engaging conversation materials and content

The sources provide several practical tips on how to prepare engaging conversation materials and content for spoken English practice:

### Choose Topics You Enjoy

- **Focus on your interests and passions**:  When you're genuinely interested in a topic, you'll naturally have more to say and speak with more enthusiasm.  This makes you a more engaging conversational partner, as people are drawn to those who are passionate about what they're talking about.
- **Think about topics you discuss comfortably in your native language**: If you enjoy discussing movies, books, travel, or current events in your native language, you can likely discuss them in English too.
- **Prepare a "spoken English book"**:  Jot down words, phrases, and ideas related to your favorite topics.  This personalized resource will help you remember vocabulary and structure your thoughts.

### Utilize Online Resources

- **Quora (American equivalent of Zhihu):** Explore diverse viewpoints on a wide range of topics.  Pay attention to how users express their opinions and structure their arguments.  This helps you learn conversational phrases and observe real-world discussion dynamics.
- **IMDb:** Analyze movie reviews to see how native speakers articulate their thoughts and feelings.  You'll encounter a variety of opinions and persuasive language, which can enhance your vocabulary and expressive range.
- **Interview-style shows:** Watch shows like "Carpool Karaoke," "The Ellen DeGeneres Show," or late-night talk shows to observe authentic conversations between hosts and guests.  Pay attention to the flow of conversation, humor, and how they engage with each other.

### Go Beyond Superficial Topics

- **Avoid cliché questions**:  Instead of asking foreigners the same tired questions ("Where are you from?" "Do you like Chinese food?"), delve into more meaningful topics.
- **Consider topics relevant to China's context**:  You could discuss issues like the one-child policy, human rights, or democracy.
- **Prepare in-depth**: Whatever topics you choose, make sure you have a deeper understanding than just surface-level knowledge.  This allows you to contribute meaningfully to the conversation and avoid awkward situations where the other person knows more than you.

### Rephrase and Personalize

- **Don't memorize scripts verbatim:**  Instead, try to understand the essence of the material you're learning and express it in your own words.
- **Practice "translation"**: Find information in English about topics you enjoy and rephrase it as you would naturally explain it to someone.  This helps you internalize the vocabulary and grammar.

Remember, the goal is to **develop your own voice and communication style**. By choosing topics you're passionate about and actively engaging with relevant materials, you'll be better prepared to have meaningful conversations in English.
