## Conversational snippets

"Conversational snippets" refer to **short segments of natural, spoken language that capture the essence of real-life conversations**. They are like **small building blocks of authentic communication** that you can collect and use as inspiration for improving your own spoken English.

Think of them as **snapshots of how native speakers express themselves in different situations**. They can be:

- **phrases**
- **expressions**
- **short exchanges between people**

You can find these snippets in various sources like:

- **Talk shows**
- **Interview programs**
- **Online platforms where people share their opinions, like Quora and IMDB movie reviews**

Instead of memorizing entire dialogues from textbooks, focusing on these snippets allows you to **learn how people actually speak in a more organic way**.

For example, a conversational snippet from a talk show could be:

- "I might be a little subjective on this one, but my answer would be..."

This phrase is useful for politely expressing your opinion, especially when it might differ from others.

By collecting and practicing with these snippets, you can:

- **Develop a more natural and engaging speaking style**
- **Expand your vocabulary with commonly used expressions**
- **Learn how to navigate different conversational topics**

Your personalized "spoken English book" can serve as a repository for these valuable conversational snippets.
