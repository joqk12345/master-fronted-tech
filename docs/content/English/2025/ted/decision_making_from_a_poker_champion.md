##  3 lessons on decision-making from a poker champion

So I'm a professional poker player,
and today, I want to talk about three things that the game has taught me
around decision-making that I find apply to everyday life.
Now the first of these things is about luck.
Now, like poker, life is also a game of skill and luck,
and when it comes to the biggest things we care about --
health, wealth and relationships --
these outcomes don't only depend on the quality of our decision-making,
but also the roll of life's dice.
For example, we can be perfectly health-conscious
and still get unlucky with something like cancer.
Or we can smoke 20 a day and live to a ripe old age,
and this kind of ambiguity can make it hard for us to know
how good our strategies are, sometimes,
especially when we're experiencing a lot of success.
For example, back in 2010,
I won a really big poker tournament known as the European Poker Tour.
And because I'd only been playing full-time for about a year,
when I won, I assumed I must be rather brilliant.
In fact, I thought I was so brilliant
that I not only got rather lazy with studying the game,
but I also got more risky,
started playing in the biggest tournaments I could
against the very best in the world.
And then my profit graph went from a thing of beauty
to something kind of sad,
with this worrying downhill trend for a long time,
until I finally realized that I was overestimating my skill level,
and got my act together.
And this kind of reminds me of what we've been seeing
in the cryptocurrency space, at least in 2017,
where the only thing that's been going up faster than the markets themselves
is the number of "senior investment specialists"
who have been appearing out of nowhere.
Now I'm not saying it's not possible to have a strategic edge,
but at the same time, it's very easy to feel like a genius
when you're in a market that's going up so fast
that even the worst strategies are making a profit.
So when we're experiencing success,
it's important to take a moment to really ask ourselves
how much of it is truly down to us,
because our egos love to downplay the luck factor when we're winning.
Now, a second thing poker taught me
is the importance of quantifying my thinking.
When you're playing, you can't just get away with going,
"Eh, they're probably bluffing."
That's just going to lose you a bunch of money,
because poker is a game of probabilities and precision,
and so you have to train yourself to think in numbers.
So now, whenever I catch myself
thinking vaguely about something really important, like,
"It's unlikely I'll forget what I want to say in my TED Talk,"
I now try to estimate it numerically.
(Laughter)
Trust me, it helps a lot with the planning process.
And the thing is, almost anything that could possibly happen here today,
or at any point in the future,
can also be expressed as a probability, too.
(Laughter)
So now I also try to speak in numbers as well.
So if someone asks me,
"Hey, Liv, do you think you're going to come along to that thing tonight?"
instead of just saying to them, "Yeah, probably,"
I actually give them my best estimate --
say, 60 percent.
Because -- I know that sounds a little odd --
but the thing is, I ran a poll on Twitter
of what people understand the word "probably" to mean,
and this was the spread of answers.
Enormous!
So apparently, it's absolutely useless
at actually conveying any real information.
So if you guys catch yourselves using these vague words,
like "probably" or "sometimes,"
try, instead, using numbers, because when we speak in numbers,
we know what lands in the other person's brain.
Now, the third thing I want to touch on today is intuition.
How often have you seen these kinds of inspirational memes
in your Facebook feed?
They're nice, right?
It's lovely. Yes. "Trust your soul."
Well, they're terrible advice.
These are some of the best poker players in the world right now.
Do they look like people who live purely off feelings and intuitions?
(Laughter)
Look at them!
Obviously, these guys are about slow, careful analysis,
and that's because the game has outgrown the days
where pure street smarts and people-reading
can get you to the top.
And that's because our intuitions aren't nearly as perfect
as we'd like to believe.
I mean, it'd be great, whenever we're in a tough spot,
to just have an answer appear to us from some magical source of inspiration.
But in reality, our gut is extremely vulnerable
to all kinds of wishful thinking and biases.
So then, what is our gut good for?
Well, all the studies I've read
conclude that it's best-suited for everyday things
that we have lots and lots of experience in,
like how we just know that our friend is mad at us
before we've even said anything to them,
or whether we can fit our car into a tight parking spot.
But when it comes to the really big stuff,
like what's our career path going to be
or who should we marry,
why should we assume that our intuitions
are better calibrated for these than slow, proper analysis?
I mean, they don't have any data to be based off.
So my third lesson is, while we shouldn't ignore our intuitions,
we shouldn't overprivilege them either.
And I'd like to summarize these three lessons today
with my own set of memes,
with more of a poker-player twist.
"Success is sweetest when you achieve it across a large sample size."
(Laughter)
"Your gut is your friend and so is a cost-benefit analysis.
(Laughter)
"The future is unknown, but you can damn well try and estimate it."
Thank you.
(Applause)

## 从扑克世界冠军中学到的三个决策经验

作为一名职业扑克玩家，我今天想分享三点从扑克游戏中学到的决策制定经验，这些经验同样适用于日常生活。

首先，谈谈运气的重要性。和扑克一样，生活也是技巧和运气的结合。在我们关心的健康、财富和人际关系等重大事项上，结果不仅取决于我们的决策质量，还受到运气的影响。比如，我们可以非常注重健康，但仍可能不幸患上癌症；反之，有人每天抽20根烟却能长寿。这种不确定性有时让我们难以评估策略的好坏，尤其是当我们取得巨大成功时。

举个例子，2010年，我赢得了欧洲扑克巡回赛的冠军。当时，我全职打扑克仅一年，便自认为非常聪明。结果，我变得懒于学习，还冒险参加最大的比赛，与世界顶尖选手对决。随后，我的盈利曲线从美丽变得令人担忧，直到我意识到自己高估了能力，才重新振作。这让我想起2017年的加密货币市场，市场快速上涨，许多人自称为“高级投资专家”。虽然战略优势是可能的，但在快速上涨的市场中，即使最差的策略也能获利。因此，当我们取得成功时，重要的是冷静评估运气的作用，避免高估自己的能力。

第二点，扑克教会我量化思维的重要性。在扑克中，你不能仅凭“他们可能在诈唬”这种模糊的想法行事，因为扑克是一个概率和精确性的游戏，需要用数字思考。因此，现在每当我对某些重要事情有模糊的想法时，如“我不太可能忘记TED演讲的内容”，我会尝试用数字来估计。这对规划过程帮助很大。几乎任何可能发生的事情都可以用概率来表达。所以，当有人问我，“嘿，Liv，你今晚会来吗？”我会给出一个具体的估计，比如60%。虽然这听起来有点奇怪，但我在Twitter上做了个调查，发现人们对“可能”一词的理解差异很大。因此，用数字表达可以更准确地传达信息。

最后，谈谈直觉。你是否经常在社交媒体上看到这些鼓舞人心的名言？它们看起来很美好，比如“相信你的灵魂”。但这是糟糕的建议。这些是世界上最好的扑克玩家，他们显然依赖于慢速、仔细的分析，而不是仅凭直觉。因为我们的直觉并不像我们想象的那样完美。直觉适用于我们有大量经验的日常事务，但在涉及职业选择或婚姻等重大决策时，应依靠慢速、仔细的分析。我们的直觉容易受到各种愿望和偏见的影响。

总结这三点经验，我想用一些扑克玩家的名言来表达：
- “成功最甜美的时候，是在大样本量中取得的。”
- “你的直觉是朋友，成本效益分析也是。”
- “未来未知，但你可以努力估计。”

谢谢大家！（掌声）
