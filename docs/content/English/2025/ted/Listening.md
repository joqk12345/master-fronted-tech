# Listening



**"Hearing" refers to the physiological process of perceiving sounds, while "listening" implies actively paying attention to and processing those sounds.** For example, you might hear traffic noise but not be actively listening to it.

Let's define listening as making meaning from sound.

It's a mental process, and it's a process of extraction. 

we use some pretty cool techniques to do this.

* One of them is pattern recognition.
* And then there is a whole range of filters.
* Intention is very important in sound, in listening. 
* Sound places us in space and in time. 
* we would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time

  from past to future.
