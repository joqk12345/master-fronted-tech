# Coinbase CEO predicts 10% of global GDP to be on crypto rails by 2030



Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says it’s the “dawn of a new era for crypto” in the US and predicted that as much as 10% of global GDP will be crypto-based by 2030. 

“Up to 10% of global GDP could be running on crypto rails by the end of this decade,” Armstrong said during Coinbase’s Feb. 13 fourth-quarter 2024 earnings [call](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZLdIV8gC6hY).

Armstrong compared the current movement of companies trying to integrate crypto to the early 2000s, when every company had to figure out how to adapt to the internet.

“Onchain is the new online,” he said.

If Armstrong’s prediction plays out, it would mean over $10 trillion in value would be [tokenized](https://cointelegraph.com/news/wall-street-is-betting-on-30-t-rwa-tokenization) or onchain, based on today’s global GDP of over $100 trillion, [according](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) to the World Bank.

He told investors that “Coinbase is going to be the preferred partner to come in and build this for many of the companies out there” as [his firm reported](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-earnings-q4-revenue-surge-beat-analyst-expectations) a total Q4 revenue of $2.3 billion, up 88% quarter-on-quarter.

Armstrong said that the US, which represents around 30% of the world’s GDP, would lead the way as “President Trump is moving fast to fulfill his promise of making the US the crypto capital of the planet.”

He added the US now has the “most pro-crypto Congress” the company has seen, which is leading the charge on stablecoin and market structure legislation, which he said the rest of the world would follow.

> “Given the US leadership here, the rest of the world is taking notice and will be under pressure to embrace crypto adoption.”

This week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller [called for stablecoin regulations](https://cointelegraph.com/news/fed-governor-waller-calls-framework-banks-issue-stablecoins) to enable banks to issue dollar-pegged digital assets.

For the year ahead, Armstrong said it was going to be about “growing revenue with our existing products.”

“It’s going to be about driving utility in these new categories where crypto is getting to scale” and “building the foundations to power this next decade of growth,” he said. 

Coinbase posted its [strongest quarterly earnings](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-expected-revenue-increase-q4-coinmetrics) in over a year, far beating analyst projections on its revenue.
